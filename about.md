### David

Hi, I'm David. This is my blog. I've mostly worked as a geologist, but this is *my* blog and it's probably going to have little or nothing to do with geology. I'm interested in technology, particularly in infosec/hacking. I'm also interested in GIS.

#### Hacking?

Yes, I'm interested in *ethical* hacking. I go by the username of 'ordinaryday' on Hack the Box, TryHackMe and HackerOne, and 'ordinary_day' on various infosec/hacking discord servers.

#### Jekyll

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
