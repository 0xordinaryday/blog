## Introduction
*Difficulty: Easy  
Tested: VMware Workstation 15.x Pro (This works better with VMware rather than VirtualBox)  
Goal: Get the root shell i.e.(root@localhost:~#) and then obtain flag under /root).*

Okay then, let's go.

## nmap
All we've got is FTP and HTTP on port 80; nothing else. Nothing on the top 1000 UDP ports. FTP is VSFTPD 3.0.3 which is not vulnerable; same with Apache 2.4.38. 

# FTP
Anonymous login is not allowed. Fuzzing for subdomains turns up nothing, and gobusting turns up nothing either, even with the larger wordlists. We did get a picture of a Chili from the front page of the webserver, but the usual stego attacks get nothing (stegcracker, checking LSBs, exiftool, binwalk etc).

This box is supposed to be easy - what does that leave? Bruteforcing FTP.

Okay, so we're in.

After some enumeration on the box turns up nothing useful, it's time to try putting a shell on the server and executing it. We can **put** with FTP, but only in one particular web directory: */var/www/html/.nano/*.

We can load the shell just fine (pentest monkey, as usual), but initially it won't fire. Why not? We need to chmod it.

{% highlight shell %}
ftp> chmod 775 shell.php
200 SITE CHMOD command ok.
{% endhighlight %}

Once that's done, we can catch our shell and we're on the box.

## Privesc
Linpeas to the rescue; **/etc/passwd** is writeable. Same as [sunset/twilight](https://blog.gibbons.digital/hacking/2020/08/27/twilight.html):

{% highlight shell %}
www-data@chili:/dev/shm$ openssl passwd mrcake
openssl passwd mrcake

www-data@chili:/dev/shm$ echo "root2:WVLY0mgH0RtUI:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
<Y0mgH0RtUI:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
www-data@chili:/dev/shm$ su root2
su root2
Password: mrcake

root@chili:/dev/shm# cd /root
cd /root
