Long time no post. I have being doing some stuff, but nothing too enthralling or particularly worth recording. With a lack of new content on VulnHub and *interesting* new content on THM, I've been having a bit of a look at Root-Me. This however, is about the new THM room [Masterminds](https://tryhackme.com/room/mastermindsxlq).

I'm not going through the whole thing there. It's interesting (so check it out), but basically it's using [Brim](https://www.brimdata.io/) to analyze some packet captures.

It's set up with an Ubuntu 'attackbox' you're supposed to use, with Brim already installed. However, the attackbox sucks so let's not use that. We can download Brim and try to install it:

It doesn't work, because it wants **libappindicator3-1**, and that's not in the Kali repos. We need to add these lines:

{% highlight shell %}
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-updates main
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib
{% endhighlight %}   

to **/etc/apt/sources.list**, and then update and install:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/tmp]
â””â”€# apt install libappindicator3-1

You might want to run 'apt --fix-broken install' to correct these.

And we're good. Launching Brim from the menu is a fail, because I'm running as root:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/mastermindsxlq]
â””â”€# brim             
[3164:1008/053956.159960:FATAL:electron_main_delegate.cc(253)] Running as root without --no-sandbox is not supported. See https://crbug.com/638180.
zsh: trace trap  brim
{% endhighlight %} 
						
So we have to run it with --no-sandbox

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/mastermindsxlq]
â””â”€# brim --no-sandbox

05:40:05.229 â€º zed core log /root/.config/Brim/logs/zlake.log
# etc 
{% endhighlight %} 

And we're golden. We can get the IP of the attackbox and start a python server there, and download the pcaps once we've connected via OpenVPN, e.g. 

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/mastermindsxlq]

From there it's a matter of importing the pcap into Brim and working through the challenge. I'd never seen Brim before but it's pleasingly inutitive to use, so well done to the creators.

Oh, this isn't a writeup of the answers.
