## Sorting
I signed up for VIP and ordered the retired machines by owns, descending. I figured this was a reasonable proxy for difficulty, ignoring the user supplied ratings. That meant the first box was Lame. I have heard of it but I've never done it and I don't know anything about it.

## Ports
We've got FTP, SSH, and SMB on 139/445. It's a Linux box.

## FTP
We've got anonymous login. It's VSFTPD 2.3.4 which was a version that got [backdoored](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-vsftpd-backdoor.html) however some enumeration indicates we don't have the vulnerable version. We don't seem to be able to put files and there are no files available on the server. Let's move on.

## SMB
Really this is all we've got left. We can get some information:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/htb/lame]
â””â”€# smbmap -d workgroup -H 10.10.10.3

        tmp                                                     READ, WRITE     oh noes!
        opt                                                     NO ACCESS
        IPC$                                                    NO ACCESS       IPC Service (lame server (Samba 3.0.20-Debian))
        ADMIN$                                                  NO ACCESS       IPC Service (lame server (Samba 3.0.20-Debian))
{% endhighlight %}

Okay, we have a writeable share. We'll go with Metasploit, even though I don't usually:

{% highlight shell %}
msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > show options

Module options (exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script):

   RPORT   139              yes       The target port (TCP)

No doubt they get more difficult from here!
