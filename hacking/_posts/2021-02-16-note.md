## Fuzzing

Interminable fuzzing for some hidden morsel is not fun, *especially* on rate limited servers, and *double especially* when those servers shut themselves off after an hour or two, so you can't even leave it alone to do something more productive. Yes, I am annoyed I have made no progress. But it isn't even because I can't figure out *how* to exploit something; it's because I've wasted *hours* looking for the thing (and not finding it). Grrr.
