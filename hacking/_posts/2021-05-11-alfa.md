## ALFA: 1
This is [ALFA: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/alfa-1,655/) from Vulnhub. It's rated as Medium, and appears on the [NetSecFocus](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0) Trophy Room list. 

I had been doing the DriftingBlues series; I'd done 7 and 6 then the privesc on 5 was like super CTF-ish and I was like meh and then I started 4 and it was multiple base64 encoded strings and some nonsense I was like nah I'm done with this son. Anyway, Alfa.

## Ports
This box has FTP, HTTP, SMB and SSH on a non-standard port. 

## FTP
We've got anonymous access and find a username; thomas. We get a picture of a dog, and we can't *put* anything. Moving on.

## Dog picture
I try exiftool and stegseek; nothing. The filename is *milo.jpg*. 

## HTTP
In robots.txt we have this:

>/home  
/admin  
/login  
/images  
/cgi-bin  
/intranet  
/wp-admin  
/wp-login  

And most of these things don't exist. At the very bottom, we have this:

>++++++++++[>+>+++>+++++++>++++++++++<<<<-]>>+++++++++++++++++.>>---.+++++++++++.------.-----.<<--.>>++++++++++++++++++.++.-----..-.+++.++.

And if you go [here](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/) you can find out that points to **/alfa-support**.

If we go there, we get this:

>â—ˆThomas:âž¤Hi! I am Thomas Miller, employee number 300197 âœ”âœ”  
â—ˆAlfa IT Support:âž¤Good morning! nice to greet you Thomas, Â¿How can help you? âœ”âœ”  
â—ˆThomas:âž¤I have a problem with my password, I partially forgot it, I only remember that it is the name of my pet followed by 3 numerical digits. Could you reset my password? âœ”âœ”  
â—ˆAlfa IT Support:âž¤With pleasure Thomas, in a maximum of 24-48 hours you will receive an SMS on your corporate phone with your new temporary password, which you will have to change later. regards. âœ”âœ”  

Righto. So the name of the pet is *milo* (we assume) and the numbers are presumably between 100 and 999. I generate a wordlist with python and feed it to Hydra:

``
hydra -l thomas -P ./passwords ssh://192.168.1.65:65111
``

And we get a hit: 

>thomas:milo666

## Privesc
We can SSH in as *thomas*; now what? Linpeas shows:

>root       486  0.0  3.2 128952 47808 ?        S    11:31   0:00 /usr/bin/Xtigervnc :1 -desktop Alfa:1 (root) -auth /root/.Xauthority -geometry 1900x1200 -depth 24 -rfbwait 30000 -rfbauth /root/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5901 -pn -localhost -SecurityTypes VncAuth

That's Xtigervnc running as root. It's on port 5901:

>tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5901          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -

In our home directory, we have:

``
4,0K -rwxrwxrwx 1 root   root     16 dic 17 23:35 .remote_secret
``

Now I wasn't familiar with any of this before, so this was a nice learning experience. I installed *tigervnc-viewer* on my Kali:

``
apt-cache search vncviewer
``

>tigervnc-viewer - Virtual network computing client for X

``
apt install tigervnc-viewer
``

And set up an SSH port forward:

``
ssh -p 65111 -L 5901:localhost:5901 thomas@192.168.1.65
``

Now; I was guessing the **.remote_secret** file (owned by root) was some sort of credentials, so I copied it over to my machine. I also ran **vncpasswd** on the server and checked that the created file (/home/thomas/.vnc/passwd) looked similar to the .remote_secret file; it did.

To start tigervnc-viewer from the command line with a specified password file we use this syntax:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/alfa]
â””â”€# vncviewer -passwd .remote_secret

And separately, we get root in a TigerVNC session. Apparently I can't copy and paste from there (grrr) so I'll send myself a shell just to prove it really happened:

{% highlight shell %}

Yeah you can probably copy and paste from there if you can be bothered to figure out how; I can't. Anyway this was pretty good and I learned some stuff so yay!
