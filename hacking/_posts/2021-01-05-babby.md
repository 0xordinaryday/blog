## First VM
This is just a really quick note. I didn't do any practice yesterday because I made my first VM instead. It's pretty basic but I'm happy with how it turned out so I've reached out to Vulnhub about submitting it, so we'll see what happens there.

I don't want any spoilers here but it's an Ubuntu box running a website, built in Virtualbox. So let's see if it gets posted or not! I did consider posting to THM but I've seen comments previously that their deployment pipeline is really full and they only release one box every few days at most, so I'd be waiting months most likely.
