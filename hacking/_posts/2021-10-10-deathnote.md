Long time no post eh. What have I been up to? Can't remember lol. I did [Horizontall](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/374) from HackTheBox. I did a few [crackmes](https://crackmes.one/). I did some stuff from THM. I tried to do [Darkhole 2](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/darkhole-2,740/) from VulnHub but I couldn't connect to it from my Kali VM. Whatever. 

Oh, and just now I did [DEATHNOTE: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/deathnote-1,739/) from VulnHub. 

## Ports
HTTP and SSH.

## HTTP
Attempting to go to the IP just gives a message about not being able to reach *deathnote.vuln*, so add this to /etc/hosts and try again. It's a wordpress install. There is a hint:

>Find a notes.txt file on server

Where does stuff go on Wordpress? **wp-content/uploads**

>http://deathnote.vuln/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/

{% highlight shell %}

Looks like we have usernames and passwords. Try wpscan:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/deathnote]
â””â”€# wpscan -U ./user -P ./pass --url http://deathnote.vuln/wordpress      
# etc

Oh. Hydra then?

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/deathnote]
â””â”€# hydra -L ./user -P ./pass ssh://deathnote.vuln

Bingo. Let's login:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/deathnote]
â””â”€# ssh l@deathnote.vuln

{% endhighlight %}

Now what? Looking around we have another user, kira. We can read their *authorized_keys* file:

{% highlight shell %}
l@deathnote:/home/kira/.ssh$ ls -lash

{% endhighlight %}

That's our user. We can copy down the id_rsa key for our user (l), chmod 600 on it and log in as *kira*.

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/deathnote]
â””â”€# chmod 600 id_rsa

And done. I liked this because even though it was themed I didn't need to know anything about the story/characters (it's some anime thing I think), but it probably added some flavour if you're into that particular thing. So that's good.
