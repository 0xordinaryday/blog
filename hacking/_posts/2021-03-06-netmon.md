## Netmon
In terms of pwns it goes Devel > OpenAdmin > Netmon but I've already done OpenAdmin so this is Netmon. Looking at the IP it's fairly high (10.10.10.152), I reckon it is from not long before I joined HTB. I've never tried it before.

## Ports
There are lots of ports:

1. 21/tcp    open  ftp
2. 80/tcp    open  http
3. 135/tcp   open  msrpc
4. 139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn
5. 445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds
6. 5985/tcp  open  wsman
7. 47001/tcp open  winrm
8. 49664/tcp open  unknown
9. 49665/tcp open  unknown
10. 49666/tcp open  unknown
11. 49667/tcp open  unknown
12. 49668/tcp open  unknown
13. 49669/tcp open  unknown

I run detail scans against everything below 49664; the main pertinent points are anonymous FTP access and *PRTG Network Monitor* on port 80. Network Monitor; obviously where the name comes from.

## FTP
We can login to FTP and we get access to the entire filesystem, although we can't read *everything*. We do get the user flag here though, which must be the most trivial HTB user flag ever. 

Some [research](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46527) reveals we have an authenticated RCE for *PRTG Network Monitor* but the default credentials (prtgadmin/prtgadmin) aren't working. Presumably then we need to find some creds via this FTP connection.

## Creds
We do find some relevant files:

>PRTG Configuration.dat

This contains passwords, but they are encrypted and we don't have the ability to decrypt them. We also find:

>PRTG Configuration.old.bak

This contains some plaintext credentials: 

>prtgadmin:PrTg@dmin2018

However this doesn't work either. Hmmmm. This box was worked on in 2019 - what if we try **PrTg@dmin2019**? Bingo!

Now for the exploit. I try the script from exploitdb but it doesn't seem to work; I may have done something wrong. I find another one on [github](https://github.com/wildkindcc/CVE-2018-9276), but it's written for python2 and wants the python2 version of impacket. We can get those:

{% highlight shell %}

Now we can run the exploit:

``
