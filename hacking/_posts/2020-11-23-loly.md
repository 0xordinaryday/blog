## Introduction
*Difficulty: Easy  
Tested: VMware Workstation 15.x Pro (This works better with VMware rather than VirtualBox)  
Goal: Get the root shell i.e.(root@localhost:~#) and then obtain flag under /root).*  

This is [LOLY: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/loly-1,538/) from Vulnhub. 

## Ports
We've got one port only - HTTP on Port 80.

## Wordpress
Really the only thing on the webserver is a Wordpress installation, and we find it easily with gobuster. **wpscan** reveals only a single user (*loly*), and easily finds the password:

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/loly# wpscan --url http://192.168.1.117/wordpress -U 'loly' -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/probable-v2-top12000.txt

So I logged in, expecting to perhaps upload a plugin zip file, or edit a theme or something. But, no.

We have several plugins (AdRotate, Helly Dolly and Akismet) - only AdRotate is 'unusual'. It's version 5.8.6.2. Searchsploit reveals SQLi vulnerabilities in several older versions - all version 3.x. 

We have several themes, including *Feminine Style* and *Virtue*, but these don't seem to be vulnerable. 

We can't upload a new plugin (the button to do so is missing), and I'm ... stuck.

After a while I consult a writeup to see what the move is. It turns out that the AdRotate plugin can be exploited by uploading a shell in a ZIP file format as a 'banner image'. PHP files are blacklisted but ZIP is okay; the plugin automatically unzips the file and places it in the banners directory:

>http://loly.lc/wordpress/wp-content/banners/rev-plugin.php

Navigating to this file triggers the shell.

I did the rest of the box by myself, but then I returned to this point. I tried googling for this exploit method, but the only references I found were in Loly writeups! And here's what they had to say about it:

1. w found a vulnerable plugin( AdRotate ) we upload a shell by compressing our payload a zip file as a new banners file  
2. i found a way to upload a shell & execute it  
3. Make sure that first, we need to upload the reverse shell as zip format  
4. For this, I saw that we have a plugin named "AdRotate" installed where we can upload a zip file 

Huh? None of these say *how* they knew this plugin was vulnerable, or how to exploit it, or provide a link to a CVE, blog post or anything else. I understand my writeups aren't always detailed; they aren't meant to be. But I don't quite understand how all of the ones I looked at just somehow magically knew that this method was available with AdRotate? Presumably there was an article about it somewhere; maybe my google-fu has failed me.

## Loly
Anyway, I'm on as *loly*. 

I run linpeas and find a password then *su loly*.

## Root
Linpeas also says we have an older kernel, which is true.

I obtain and run the [Linux Exploit Suggester](https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester) script:

It suggests several as highly probable. I usually don't have much luck with kernel exploits, but let's go:
