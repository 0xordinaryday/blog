## Introduction
This box has no description or explanation. Okey dokey.

This is [KIRA: CTF](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kira-ctf,594/) from Vulnhub. 

## Ports
Well, we always run nmap right? Lol no. This box has *autologon* enabled! I start it up and it immediately logs on as *bassam* with the full Ubuntu GUI experience. Who cares what ports are open?

## Enumeration
There is a webservice presumably, because there's stuff in */var/www/html* including a directory called */supersecret-for-aziz*. This contains a file called *bassam-pass.txt*, which is useful. The password is **Password123!@#**. 

## Privesc
We can run *sudo -l* and enter our password; turns out we can run find as root. So that's our privesc done and done; thanks [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find/#sudo). The final flag was:

>THM{root-Is_Better-Than_All-of-THEM-31337}

Presumably this is or was going to be a THM box? What a bizarre experience. I didn't even need Kali at all. This entire thing, including the (lol) writeup, took 23 mins from boot of the VM.

Looking in */var/www/html* there was an *upload.php* file that was filtering for image extensions, presumably this was supposed to be the foothold. Oh well, maybe next time.
