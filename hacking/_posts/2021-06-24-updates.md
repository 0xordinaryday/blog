## Away
I was away for a few days with just an old laptop setup with Kali as the OS. It didn't have enough grunt to run any VMs, so it was THM only. Since there wasn't much new I went and did a few older CTFs that I hadn't done before: 

1. Pickle Rick. I tried to watch one episode of Rick and Morty once and was like meh and turned it off; why is this fandom so annoying? Anyway, nothing really new to report from this. 
2. Biohazard. This was an older Resident Evil themed CTF and it was *super* CTF. But it was okay, just a bit annoying to do with a barely functional touchpad and no mouse.
3. I'd already done Juicy Details but it was just reading logs and answering questions, no big deal.
4. Volatility. This was actually interesting. However Volaltility is no longer in the Kali repo and installing it is a pain is the ass, and the room doesn't tell you how to do it. May do some more in this field. It's a bit like the Autopsy thing; maybe it's just because it's novel but I found it interesting.

Then I got home and tried to do [HackathonCTF: 2](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hackathonctf-2,714/) from VulnHub but the stupid thing wouldn't get an IP address either as bridged or NAT. Deleted.

Next, I tried [https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hackable-ii,711/](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hackathonctf-2,714/). It took like 10 minutes.

## Ports
HTTP, SSH and FTP. Let's begin with FTP.

## FTP
We have anonymous login with upload, and the directory contains a HTML file. HMMMMMMM WONDER WHAT THAT MEANS?

And where did our shell go?

Run a random script in a CTF without checking the contents? Erm, no thanks.

Almost took longer to write this than to do it.
