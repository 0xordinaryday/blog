## Introduction
*Will you be consumed by Madness?*  

This is a easy rated box. Let's begin.

## Ports
nmap says we've got 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) only.  

## Webserver
To start with, this appears to be simply the Apache default page. But hidden away is a comment:

{% highlight html %}
<img src="thm.jpg" class="floating_element"/>
<!-- They will never find me-->
{% endhighlight %}

We can grab the file with wget:

``
kali:/opt/tryhackme/madness# wget http://madness.thm/thm.jpg
``

The file is corrupted, but we can repair it with *hexeditor* by replacing the first 12 bytes with **FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01** to reveal a hidden directory:

http://madness.thm/th1s_1s_h1dd3n/

## Secret
The page says:
>Welcome! I have been expecting you!
To obtain my identity you need to guess my secret! 

So now we can do:
http://madness.thm/th1s_1s_h1dd3n/?secret=0

And the source code reveals the 'secret' value is between 0 and 99. With Burp Turbo Intruder we can establish that it is 73, and we get the message:
>Urgh, you got it right! But I won't tell you who I am! y2RPJ4QaPF!B

This string is the used as a passphrase for the repaired JPG from earlier to extract some hidden text:

>Fine you found the password!  
Here's a username  
wbxre  
I didn't say I would make it easy for you!

This is ROT13 encoding for the word **joker**.

However, we can't SSH in as joker with y2RPJ4QaPF!B as the password, because the password is something else.

## So, what is it?
Yep, I had to check a writeup. You go to the *room page* on the THM website, download a picture from there and run steghide with no password to get the hidden file; the password is ***axA&GF8dP**. 

Can I just say, *that's some real bullshit*. You might have a different view and that's fine, but I wasn't impressed.

## Root
Run linpeas, find out 'screen' is a PE vector. Quick google, find an exploit, run it, root. F*** this box.

[Exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41154)
{% highlight shell %}
#!/bin/bash
