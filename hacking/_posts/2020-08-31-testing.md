## Here, or meta?
Really this is a test to see if I can write a blog post on my phone with Joplin and then push it to my github repo using termux.

If this goes online, it worked.

Also, I did the new THM machine Game Server. It was pretty easy: grab mildly hidden SSH private key, crack password, SSH into server. Privesc was textbook LXD.
