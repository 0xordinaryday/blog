## Introduction
*dobby needs to be root to help harry potter, dobby needs to be a free elf  
Difficult: Easy  
This works better in VirtualBox*  

This is [HOGWARTS: DOBBY](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hogwarts-dobby,597/) from Vulnhub. 

## Ports
HTTP only; makes targeting easier.

## HTTP and Rabbits
This one has a few rabbitholes, or at least red herrings. The page title on the website homepage is:

>Draco:dG9vIGVhc3kgbm8/IFBvdHRlcg==

This decodes to:

>too easy no? Potter

This doesn't appear to be useful for anything.

At the very bottom of the page in the source code is a comment:

>See: /alohomora

If we go there, we get a message:

>Draco's password is his house ;)

### Gobuster
Gobuster finds a directory called */log*. It says:

>pass:OjppbGlrZXNvY2tz  
hint --> /DiagonAlley

The base64 encoded string decodes to:

>::ilikesocks

This doesn't appear to be useful for anything.

Going to */DiagonAlley*, we find a Wordpress installation. Maybe we're getting somewhere?

### wpscan
Enumerate with:

``
wpscan -e --url http://192.168.1.143/DiagonAlley/
``

And we have one user, *draco*. We find a post entitled *Dobby* that is written in what appears to be *brainfuck*, but running it through an interpreter only yields what might be a partial password - this is another distraction. Let's run a password attack:

``
wpscan --url http://192.168.1.143/DiagonAlley/ -U 'draco' -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
``

Success:

Apparently the hint from */alohomora* wasn't a red herring. Whatever.

### Wordpress
The installation is in Spanish (I think) so it's a bit hard to read but I can upload a malicious plugin as a zip file (see [midnight](https://blog.gibbons.digital/hacking/2020/10/23/midnight.html) for details). This gets me a shell.

## Privesc
As usual, run linpeas from /dev/shm after upgrading my shell:

{% highlight shell %}

This gives us not one but two SUID binaries of interest - *base32* and *find*. We'll take find as per [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find/#suid)

{% highlight shell %}

This box didn't have *cat* but it still had *head* and *less* so no problem. Done and done.
