This is [THOTH TECH: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/thoth-tech-1,734/) from VulnHub.

There is no information about this box. I've been banging on a few and not getting them completed lately so not many writeups. This one was easy and will be brief. I did complete the latest HTB machine Previse the other day but no write-up on that.

## Ports
FTP, SSH and HTTP. 

## FTP
We have anonymous login, one file only and no upload:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/vulnhub/thoth]
â””â”€# ftp 192.168.1.87

The file says:

>Dear pwnlab,  
My name is jake. Your password is very weak and easily crackable, I think change your password.

## HTTP
``
python3 /opt/dirsearch/dirsearch.py -u http://192.168.1.87
``

Dirsearch turns up only a few things, one of which is *wordpress* and another is *test.php* which only displays 'hi guys'. Could we break the wordpress password? Perhaps an LFI?

wpscan says:

>Scan Aborted: The URL supplied redirects to http://192.168.1.8/wordpress/. Use the --ignore-main-redirect option to ignore the redirection and scan the target, or change the --url option value to the redirected URL.

Okay then, let's use --ignore-main-redirect

``
wpscan -e --url http://192.168.1.87/wordpress --api-token GET_YOUR_OWN_ITS_FREE --ignore-main-redirect
``

>Scan Aborted: The remote website is up, but does not seem to be running WordPress.

Whatever. It's constantly trying to redirect to http://192.168.1.8. I can have a look at the page and sure enough there is blog post by *pwnlab*. What else can we try?
