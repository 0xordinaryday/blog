## Sustah
*Play a game to gain access to a vulnerable CMS. Can you beat the odds?*

This is [Sustah](https://tryhackme.com/room/sustah) from THM. It's medium rated. We have another 'hint':

*The developers have added anti-cheat measures to their game. Are you able to defeat the restrictions to gain access to their internal CMS?*

## Ports
SSH and HTTP, plus another HTTP port (8085).

## Port 80
The front page is a picture, with a quote:

>"What you are is what you have been. What youâ€™ll be is what you do now." Buddha

Cool, cool. Dirsearch draws a blank. Doesn't sound like a game though; let's try the other port.

## Port 8085
Here's the game. We find a 'spinner' wheel (like roulette), which we can 'spin'. There is also a message: 

>Feeling lucky? Guess the right number. You have a 0.004% chance of winning.

We can enter a number, and press a button to submit it. Capturing the request shows the number is submitted as a POST request to */home*. 0.004% corresponds to 1 in 25000, so it's just brute force the request with 25000 numbers, right?

Well yes, but it's not quite that simple.

### Anti-cheat
When we send a request, the server sends back a response like this:

{% highlight html %}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: gunicorn/20.0.4
Date: Tue, 26 Jan 2021 09:45:51 GMT
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 1004
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 9
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1611654412
Retry-After: 60
{% endhighlight %}

Sending more than 10 requests quickly results in a *429 - Too many requests* error.

I hadn't seen this before, but some research revealed we can set some headers of our own to try to bypass this. In the end what I did was write a script to use cURL to brute force the server, with the additional headers and also setting the user agent to the number I was sending as well; just so it wasn't always the same. I got the script to diff the server response for each value against a prototypical bad response until I got something different:

{% highlight shell %}
for i in {10000..25000}
do
  touch $i.out
  curl --silent 'http://sustah:8085/home' -H 'User-Agent: $i' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Origin: http://sustah:8085' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Referer: http://sustah:8085/home' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' -H 'X-Forwarded-For: ' -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1' -H 'X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1' -H 'X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1' -H 'X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1' --data-raw "number=$i" >> $i.out
  diff $i.out proto.out
  status=$?
    if [[ $status != 0 ]]
    then
      echo "inspect $i"
    else
      rm $i.out
    fi
done
{% endhighlight %}

This script, after some time, revealed the answer: */YouGotTh3P@th*

## The Path
The path doesn't go with port 8085, it goes on Port 80. And here, we find something called *MaraCMS*, which is a (sorry) butt-ugly [CMS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maracms/) written in PHP. You can login with default credentials (which then have to be changed); this gets you an admin account. After that I just clicked around until I found a way to upload a shell, it wasn't difficult but then later I Googled and found [instructions](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48780). Bingo. I used the Pentestmonkey PHP reverse shell.

Sorry, user kiran may not run sudo on ubuntu-xenial.

No sudo, but something similar....

## Privesc
Linpeas shows me something I've never seen before:

{% highlight shell %}
[+] Checking doas.conf
 permit nopass kiran as root cmd rsync  
{% endhighlight %}

Sorry, what? 

>The doas utility is a program originally written for OpenBSD which allows a user to run a command as though they were another user. Typically doas is used to allow non-privleged users to run commands as though they were the root user. The doas program acts as an alternative to sudo, which is a popular method in the Linux community for granting admin access to specific users.

Right, so it's basically sudo. So, with that and [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/rsync/#sudo), we should be good?
