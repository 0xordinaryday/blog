## Introduction
*What is DownUnderCTF?  
DownUnderCTF is a world-wide Capture The Flag (CTF) competition targeted at Australian High School and University Students.*

This ran over the weekend. I had a go at it when I had some spare time, and I did...okay I guess. I finished 118th out of 1080 teams so just outside the top 10%; teams could have up to 5 members or be individuals; I worked alone. 

Apparently there were something just over 3000 participants so that suggests the average team size was 3. It was pretty hard and not really similar to the sort of thing I've been doing, but here we are.
