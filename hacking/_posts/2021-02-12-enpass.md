## En-pass
*Get what you can't*

*Think-out-of-the-box*

Yeah, if you say so.

This released yesterday and I haven't completed it; I probably won't. It's SSH and HTTP only, and you do a series of repetitive but not very interesting dirbuster/gobuster/dirsearch whatever to find an encrypted private SSH key, at:

>/web/resources/infoseek/configure/key

The passphrase isn't in rockyou; you can get it by sending a nonsensical string to */reg.php*, and you can figure that out because it includes the source code. Don't bother with the nonsense, the passphrase is:

>cimihan_are_you_here?

We still need a username to connect though, and none of the ones that we might think that are scattered about seem to work.

What else do we have? A zip directory filled with 100 identical zipfiles, all of which contain the word *sadman*. A 403.php file that I suspect has some relevance. A hideously ugly frontpage with some ROT13 and Base64 encoded stuff that may or may not be trolling. Several images that probably don't contain stego things but you wouldn't know. 

All in all, this seems like the sort of 'gotcha' CTF I despise, with nothing novel or realistic. I'm not going to persist with it any further. I note that when it was released the difficulty was rated easy but it's since been bumped to medium. Whatever. 

I will amend this if and only if the challenge turns out to have some interesting parts to it.

Hopefully I'll have something more interesting to write about later.
