## RIPPER: 1
This is [RIPPER: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/ripper-1,706/) from VulnHub. 

>This is a vulnerable linux box focused on web application testing along with showing the importance of enumeration. There are three users you needs to compromise to read the root flag.  
Difficulty: Easy-Medium.

Let's go.

Oh I also did [Gaara](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/gaara-1,629/) and I've got nothing much to say about it. Base58 encoded creds on a page, password doesn't work but bruteforce SSH with the username no issue. Then rabbit holes in Brainf%%k and a GTFOBins privesc. Anyway; back to Ripper.

## Ports
HTTP, SSH and Webmin on port 10000, but not an apparently vulnerable version:

>10000/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 64 MiniServ 1.910 (Webmin httpd)  
|_http-favicon: Unknown favicon MD5: 6594483717A9D1D13CF12F31EBFDB483  
| http-methods:   
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS  
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html; Charset=iso-8859-1).

## HTTP
Probably the hardest part of this is finding the entry points: http://192.168.1.58/rips/

I typically use *seclists* for my wordlists; almost always. The word *rips* only appears in two files:

1. directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt, and
2. directory-list-lowercase-2.3-big.txt

And I basically never use these files (not the 'lowercase' versions anyway). So yes this was the hard part. Once you have it via interminable fuzzing, you can use the webpage (a PHP code analyser) to scan files in /var/www and then read one called *secret.php*, which contains the credentials for our first user. Once we have this, we SSH is as *ripper*.

## Ripper -> Cubes
If we check the bash_history for our user (ripper) we can see they go to */mnt* and look at a file called secret.file. What if we do that?

{% highlight shell %}
ripper@ripper-min:~$ cd /mnt
ripper@ripper-min:/mnt$ ls -lash
total 12K
4.0K drwxrwxr-x+  2 root  root  4.0K Jun  4 11:42 .
4.0K drwxr-xr-x  24 root  root  4.0K Jun 26 06:22 ..
4.0K -rw-rw-r--   1 cubes cubes   60 Jun  4 11:42 secret.file
ripper@ripper-min:/mnt$ cat secret.file 
This is my secret file

[file system]
-passwd : Il00tpeople
ripper@ripper-min:/mnt$ su cubes
Password: 
cubes@ripper-min:/mnt$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for cubes: 
Sorry, user cubes may not run sudo on ripper-min.
{% endhighlight %}

## Cubes -> Root
If we look at the bash_history for *cubes* we can see he was poking around in the webmin directory and making a *backup*. Let's check that:

{% highlight shell %}
cubes@ripper-min:/var/webmin/backup$ cat miniser.log

So now we have some webmin creds. It's back to https://ripper-min:10000/ where we can login and have a root shell.

{% highlight shell %}

This one was pretty good, hard to find the entry point though. Not too CTF-ish, which I appreciated.
