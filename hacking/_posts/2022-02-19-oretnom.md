There is a new TryHackMe 'room' (I still hate that term) called [Plotted-TMS](https://tryhackme.com/room/plottedtms). This post is sort of about that, but not really. First, let's get the Plotted-TMS bit out of the way. I have had a quick look at it but it's under-provisioned on the free tier so it starts out painfully slow and quickly gets worse. Once it became unresponsive twice (i.e. the original instance and a reboot), I stopped persisting with it - not that it is really the point. What I did see was that the website was running an [Online Traffic Management System](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14909/online-traffic-offense-management-system-php-free-source-code.html) with source code taken from [sourcecodetester](https://www.sourcecodester.com/). 

And, I noticed the author was someone called [oretnom23](https://www.sourcecodester.com/user/257130/activity). 

Now, I've seen code from this person(?) before, although I don't remember exactly where - but it was definitely in a CTF from one of the platforms I use - THM, VulnHub, maybe HackMyVM. 

So it got me wondering, who is this person and why are they churning out vulnerable webapps? 

On sourcecodetester, **oretnom23** has **nine pages** of 'activity', most of which is some sort of PHP/MySQL 'system'. Here are some examples:

>Simple Online Leave Management System  
>Simple Realtime Quiz System  
>Lot Reservation Management System  
>Seat Reservation System for Movie Theater  
>Computer and Mobile Repair Shop Management System   
>Simple Online Food Ordering System

There are **dozens** of these things, all uploaded relatively recently and many with the same upload date. On their [github](https://github.com/oretnom23?tab=repositories) there are 40 repos of the same flavour, mostly dating from early 2021. Hey, the pandemic gave us some spare time, right?

I *assume* most of these suffer from some sort of SQLi and/or file upload vulnerability, which is why they are fodder for CTFs. But why? WHY?

Is oretnom23 building a portfolio to show off their dev skills, but ignoring good security practices?

Is oretnom23 building deliberately vulnerable webapps for CTF practice?

Is oretnom23 building deliberately vulnerable webapps for some other reason, such as trying to create CVEs? Try googling 'oretnom23 exploit-db' and watch the shite pile up:

Is oretnom23 even a real person, or are these almost carbon copy webapps somehow generated procedurally?

And an even better question, why the hell does anyone think these make good CTF challenges? They are all more or less the same. They are (deliberately or negligently) vulnerable, and no-one should be installing and running them in a production environment, so it's not very realistic (not that being realistic is a necessity, but it's my preference). 

I understand it's not necessarily easy to come up with new stuff. But hooboy anybody making a CTF like this should add a disclaimer on the front that it's more of the same old stuff from old mate **oretnom23**. And then I'd know not to waste my time.
