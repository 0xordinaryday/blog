## Computer says no

When you try to visit [PentestMonkey](pentestmonkey.net), Google says this, in white writing on a scary red background:

>The site ahead contains harmful programs  
Attackers on pentestmonkey.net might attempt to trick you into installing programs that harm your browsing experience (for example, by changing your homepage or showing extra ads on sites that you visit).  
Learn more  
To get Chromeâ€™s highest level of security, turn on enhanced protection  

>Google Safe Browsing recently found harmful programs on pentestmonkey.net.  

>If you understand the risks to your security, you may visit this site before the harmful programs have been removed.

Yeah, sure.

Anyway, now I'm going to have some of that content here (in tools), so I'll probably get flagged the same way if I ever come to their attention. Oh well, in for a penny...
