#### I wonder...?
Ever drive/walk/run/cycle around during an election campaign and think: 'Gee, candidate A seems to have a lot more signs than candidate B?' No? Must be just me then.

#### Election season
We've got an election coming up for the Legislative Council division of Rosevears, and I've noticed that there *seems* to be a lot more signs for Jo Palmer in the parts of Launceston I frequent than for, say, Jess Greene. I've also noticed there are quite a few signs for David Fry, even though I'd never heard of him previously. Apparently that's me showing my ignorance though, because my wife knew who he was when I asked her.

#### Previous observations
I actually noticed that there *seemed* to be a lot more signs for the Liberals than Labor or the Greens etc. at the last state election too, but I didn't try counting them. I did wonder if there was a geographical distribution effect that I wasn't considering, but I didn't look into it. This time, I decided I would.

#### A quick survey
So, is it just my imagination? Well, no. I took a drive around for a while today through parts of suburban Riverside, Trevallyn, West Launceston/Summerhill and into Prospect, i.e. the urban Launceston parts of Rosevears. Here's what I found:


- 77 total signs (75 corflutes, two parked trailers with signs on them)
- 29 (38%) were for Jo Palmer (Liberal)
- 19 (25%) were for David Fry (Ind)
- 16 (21%) were for Janie Finlay (Ind)
- 7 (9%) were for Jess Greene (Labor)
- 4 (5%) were for Jack Davenport (Greens)
- 2 (2%) were for Vivienne Gale (Ind)

I did also record the approximate locations of the signs and plotted them on a map, but there was no particular geographical pattern to note. I don't claim to have seen *all* the signs in any particular area, but I saw enough to confirm my suspicions; the Liberals have many more signs than Labor, and David Fry has a surprisingly large number of signs too.
