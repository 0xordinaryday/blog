## Roses
Some people love roses, and grow gardens full of them. They feel that they the beauty and scent of the rose more than outweights the occasional thorn prick. 

From a twisted, thorny bush springs great beauty. And to appreciate that beauty, we must accept the accompanying barbs. Is this a metaphor for life?

## Roses are Liars
The *narrative* of the rose is the flower, which is fleeting. The enduring, year-round *reality* of the rose is the thorn. When the petals wither and drop, the thorn endures. When the seasons turn and the trees are bare, the thorn endures. Even when completely lifeless, a rose bush retains its fangs.

## Just Say No
There are hundreds, nay thousands, of other flowers out there that don't come along with a side of thorny baggage. Flowers that don't need you to endure their torments, because they give freely without a blood penalty. The rose *needs* you to overlook the reality, and focus on the lie: 

*I'm worth it right? Don't worry about those cuts on your hand; look at how beautiful I am...*

## No. 
Just no. Tear those prickly bastards out and don't look back - there are myriad better options. A thorn bush by any other name would be shown no mercy; see the reality for what it is.
