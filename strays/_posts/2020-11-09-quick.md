## Busy bees
This is just a quick note because I've got 5 minutes. I've been super busy these past few days, and haven't spent much time hacking or made much progress. I'm working on a couple of different vulnhub boxes. One is all about enum and honestly it's kind of painful but I'm persisting with it. The other one I've got some progress on (I can read files on the server) but I haven't managed to leverage it into RCE yet.

I've done some good stuff away from the computer (mostly in the garden) but I want to make sure this blog retains some priority and doesn't fade away. Hopefully I'll have something to write up soon.
