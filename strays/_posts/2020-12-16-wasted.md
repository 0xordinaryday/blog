## Wasting time
I don't have much in the way of themes that run through my ramblings here, but if I did, one of them would be about time. 
 
--------------------------------------------

Basically, I don't have enough of it. 

--------------------------------------------

Now that's not to say that I *always* use my time wisely; I procrastinate sometimes, and sometimes I straight up waste my time. But when it's my own time, I'm allowed to waste it *if I want to*.

But it's *not* okay when someone else wastes my time. And yes, I've just had my time wasted. And no; I didn't appreciate it.
